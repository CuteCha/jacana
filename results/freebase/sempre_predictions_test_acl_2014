A dead sinner revised and edited.","God creates out of nothing. Wonderful you say. Yes, to be sure, but he does what is still more wonderful: he makes saints out of sinners.","Saintliness is also a temptation.","We must have a real living determination to reach holiness. I will be a saint means I will despoil myself of all that is not God; I will strip my heart of all created things; I will live in poverty and detachment; I will renounce my will, my inclinations, my whims and fancies, and make myself a willing slave to the will of God.","It is well for his peace that the saint goes to his martyrdom. He is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest."]
