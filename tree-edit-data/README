This is the dataset first used in the following paper:

Mengqiu Wang, Noah A. Smith and Teruko Mitamura, What is the Jeopardy Model? A Quasi-Synchronous Grammar for Question Answering, In Proceedings of EMNLP '07, 2007

and later enriched, re-organized by Michael Heilman:

M. Heilman and N. A. Smith. 2010. Tree Edit Models for Recognizing Textual Entailments, Paraphrases, and Answers to Questions. In Proc. of NAACL/HLT

The data format is pseudo-xml. That means you can't use any XML processing libraries to read it (some characters are not escaped). To process it, just read the file line by line.

The data was POS-tagged via MXPOST, parsed via MSTParser and NER-tagged via BBN Identifinder. These tools are not easily availble anymore. Thus I re-processed them with the Stanford Parser (for POS and parsing) and the UIUC NETagger (look inside the "stanford-parsed" folder in each sub-folder).
