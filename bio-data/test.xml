        <sentence-string>Because water moves from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential, the more negative pressure potential at the air-water interface causes water in xylem cells to be &quot;pulled&quot; into mesophyll cells, which lose water to the air spaces, the water diffusing out through stomata.</sentence-string>
