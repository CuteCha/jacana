Q	In a eukaryotic cell, what kind of cell division results in a diploid cell from a diploid cell?
A	"Mitosis"
S			4.1662.1.1	An embryo is a multicellular diploid eukaryote in its earliest stage of development, from the time of first cell division until birth, hatching, or germination.
S			1.24.2.2.1.2.3	In plants, for example, a failure of cell division could double a cell's chromosome number from the diploid number (2n) to a tetraploid number (4n).
S			1.13.1.2.2.3	For example, single-celled eukaryotic organisms can reproduce asexually by mitotic cell division, in which DNA is copied and allocated equally to two daughter cells.
S			1.12.0.0.3.4	Cell division also enables multicellular eukaryotes to develop from a single cell, like the fertilized egg that gave rise to the two-celled embryo in Figure 12.2b.
S			4.808.1.3	This type of cell division in eukaryotes is known as mitosis, and leaves the daughter cell capable of dividing again.
S			4.3177.1.1	Mitosis is a cell division of somatic cells of Eukaryotic organisms which result in two daughter cells genetically identical (has same number of chromosomes as do their parent cell) to their parent cell
S			1.23.4.4.1.1.1	In diploid eukaryotes, a considerable amount of genetic variation is hidden from selection in the form of recessive alleles.
S			1.13.4.1.1.2.6	However, the population of daughter cells resulting from meiosis of a large number of diploid cells contains all four types in approximately equal numbers.
S			4.1284.1.1	Cytokinesis is the process in which the cytoplasm of a single eukaryotic cell is divided to form two daughter cells.
S			1.7.0.0.2.6	The same applies to the many varieties of internal membranes that partition the eukaryotic cell: The molecular makeup of each membrane allows compartmentalized specialization in cells.

Q	What type of cell division results in the separation of homologous chromosomes?
A	"Meiosis I"
S			1.13.4.1.1.2.1	Because each pair of homologous chromosomes is positioned independently of the other pairs at metaphase I, the first meiotic division results in each pair sorting its maternal and paternal homologs into daughter cells independently of every other pair.
S			1.24.2.2.1.1.1	A species may originate from an accident during cell division that results in extra sets of chromosomes, a condition called polyploidy.
S			1.12.1.2.3.1	Later in the cell division process, the two sister chromatids of each duplicated chromosome separate and move into two new nuclei, one forming at each end of the cell.
S			1.24.2.2.1.2.3	In plants, for example, a failure of cell division could double a cell's chromosome number from the diploid number (2n) to a tetraploid number (4n).

S			1.24.2.2.1.1.1	A species may originate from an accident during cell division that results in extra sets of chromosomes, a condition called polyploidy.
S			1.24.2.2.1.2.3	In plants, for example, a failure of cell division could double a cell's chromosome number from the diploid number (2n) to a tetraploid number (4n).
S			1.12.4.4.7	In preparation for cell division, chromosomes are duplicated, each one then consisting of two identical sister chromatids joined along their lengths by sister chromatid cohesion and held most tightly together at a constricted region at the centromeres of the chromatids.
S			1.13.3.2.5.2	During the second meiotic division, meiosis II (sometimes called the equational division), the sister chromatids separate, producing haploid daughter cells.
S			1.21.4.2.5.2	The DNA at centromeres is essential for the separation of chromatids in cell division (see Chapter 12).
S			1.13.2.2.2.5	This type of cell division reduces the number of sets of chromosomes from two to one in the gametes, counterbalancing the doubling that occurs at fertilization.
S			1.13.4.1.1.2.1	Because each pair of homologous chromosomes is positioned independently of the other pairs at metaphase I, the first meiotic division results in each pair sorting its maternal and paternal homologs into daughter cells independently of every other pair.
S			1.12.4.7.4	In anaphase, sister chromatids separate, and motor proteins move them along the kinetochore microtubules toward opposite ends of the cell.

Q	Which step of meiosis results in a reduction of ploidy?
A	"Meiosis I"	"Anaphase I"
S			1.31.4.4.6.2	In Neurospora, for example, many dikaryotic cells can develop into asci, recombining genomes during meiosis and resulting in a multitude of genetically different offspring from one mating event (see steps 2 and 3 in Figure 31.17).
S			1.9.3.2.3.3	You can see in Figure 9.12 that for each turn of the citric acid cycle, two carbons (red) enter in the relatively reduced form of an acetyl group (step 1), and two different carbons (blue) leave in the completely oxidized form of CO2 molecules (steps 3 and 4).
S			1.12.1.2.4.7	In each generation, meiosis reduces the chromosome number from 46 (two sets of chromosomes) to 23 (one set).
S			1.13.3.3.1	Many of the steps of meiosis closely resemble corresponding steps in mitosis.
S			1.13.3.2.4.4	In meiosis, sister chromatid cohesion is released in two steps, one at the start of anaphase I and one at anaphase II.
S			4.3046.1.1	Meiosis I is the first division of a two-stage process of cell division in sexually reproducing organisms that results in cells with half the number of chromosome sets as the original cell.
S			4.3048.1.1	Meiosis II is the second division of a two-stage process of cell division in sexually reproducing organisms that results in cells with half the number of chromosome sets as the original cell.
S			1.13.3.1.3.2	Meiosis halves the total number of chromosomes in a very specific way, reducing the number of sets from two to one, with each daughter cell receiving one set of chromosomes.
S			1.15.4.3.1.3.4	Most cases result from nondisjunction during meiosis I, and some research points to an age-dependent abnormality in a meiosis checkpoint that normally delays anaphase until all the kinetochores are attached to the spindle (like the M phase checkpoint of the mitotic cell cycle; see Chapter 12).
S			1.13.4.1.1.2.5	Note that only two of the four combinations of daughter cells shown in the figure would result from meiosis of a single diploid cell, because a single parent cell would have one or the other possible chromosomal arrangement at metaphase I, but not both.

Q	Which step of meiosis results in the separation of homologous chromosomes?
A	"Meiosis I"	"Anaphase I"
S			1.13.4.1.1.2.1	Because each pair of homologous chromosomes is positioned independently of the other pairs at metaphase I, the first meiotic division results in each pair sorting its maternal and paternal homologs into daughter cells independently of every other pair.
S			4.3413.1.1	A nondisjunction is an error in meiosis or mitosis in which members of a pair of homologous chromosomes or a pair of sister chromatids fail to separate properly from each other.
S			1.15.4.1.2.2	But there is an occasional mishap, called a nondisjunction, in which the members of a pair of homologous chromosomes do not move apart properly during meiosis I or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis II (Figure 15.13).
S			1.15.3.2.1.3.2	The physical basis of recombination between unlinked genes is the random orientation of homologous chromosomes at metaphase I of meiosis, which leads to the independent assortment of the two unlinked genes (see Figure 13.10 and the question in the Figure 15.2 legend).
S			1.51.4.4.1.2.9	One way to see this is in terms of the segregation of homologous chromosomes that occurs during meiosis of gametes (Figure 51.28; see also Chapter 13).
S			1.14.1.2.1.5.3	In terms of chromosomes, this segregation corresponds to the distribution of the two members of a pair of homologous chromosomes to different gametes in meiosis (see Figure 13.7).
S			4.922.1.1	A chiasma in genetics, is thought to be the point where two homologous non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material during chromosomal crossover during meiosis.
S			1.15.2.1.2.6	Short segments at either end of the Y chromosome are the only regions that are homologous with corresponding regions of the X. These homologous regions allow the X and Y chromosomes in males to pair and behave like homologous chromosomes during meiosis in the testes.
S			1.13.3.1.2.1	The overview of meiosis in Figure 13.7 shows, for a single pair of homologous chromosomes in a diploid cell, that both members of the pair are duplicated and the copies sorted into four haploid daughter cells.
S			1.21.5.4.2.1	We've already seen that unequal crossing over during meiosis can lead to duplication of a gene on one chromosome and its loss from the homologous chromosome (see Figure 21.13).

A	"Meiosis"
S			4.2902.1.1	A linkage map is a genetic map based on the frequencies of recombination between markers during crossing over of homologous chromosomes.
S			4.2192.1.1	Genetic recombination is the exchange of DNA fragments between sister chromatids of a chromosome or non sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes.
S			1.15.6.36.2	Until recently, it was thought that the genes on the Y chromosome might degenerate because they lack homologous genes on the X chromosome with which to recombine.
S			1.21.5.3.1.3	Such recombination between misaligned nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes produces one chromatid with two copies of the gene and one chromatid with no copy.
S			1.21.5.5.2.1	Transposable elements of similar sequence scattered throughout the genome facilitate recombination between different chromosomes by providing homologous regions for crossing over.
S			4.4911.1.1	The synaptonemal complex is a protein structure that forms between two homologous chromosomes during meiosis and that is thought to mediate chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination.
S			1.15.3.2.1.3.2	The physical basis of recombination between unlinked genes is the random orientation of homologous chromosomes at metaphase I of meiosis, which leads to the independent assortment of the two unlinked genes (see Figure 13.10 and the question in the Figure 15.2 legend).
S			1.27.2.2.1.2.3	Once inside the cell, the foreign DNA can be incorporated into the genome by homologous DNA exchange.
S			1.15.3.3.13.13	Also, note that in contrast to the homologous autosomes (II-IV), the X and Y sex chromosomes (I) have distinct shapes.
S			1.27.2.2.2.5.4	When chromosomal DNA from an Hfr cell enters an F-' cell, homologous regions of the Hfr and F-' chromosomes may align, allowing segments of their DNA to be exchanged.

Q	What helps DNA to condense in bacteria?

S			1.27.7.15.4	Experiments with bacteria such as E. coli have led to important advances in DNA technology.
S			1.27.2.2.1.6	Although scientists have found evidence that each of these mechanisms can transfer DNA within and between species in both domain Bacteria and domain Archaea, to date most of our knowledge comes from research on bacteria.
S			1.12.2.4.4.1	Using the techniques of modern DNA technology to tag the origins of replication with molecules that glow green in fluorescence microscopy (see Figure 6.3), researchers have directly observed the movement of bacterial chromosomes.

S			1.18.2.2.3.1.6	Working in the opposite order, proteins have also been found that first bind to methylated DNA and then recruit histone deacetylation enzymes.
S			1.21.4.3.3.1	In multigene families that consist of identical DNA sequences, those sequences are usually clustered tandemly and, with the notable exception of the genes for histone proteins, have RNAs as their final products.
S			1.17.4.1.2.2.7	About one-third of the mass of a ribosome is made up of proteins; the rest consists of rRNAs, either three molecules (in bacteria) or four (in eukaryotes).

S			1.23.1.4.1	Sources of Genetic Variation
S			1.13.4.1.1	Origins of Genetic Variation Among Offspring
S			1.23.5.21.3	The main source of genetic variation among human individuals is
S			1.13.4.6.2	As you will learn in more detail in later chapters, mutations are the original source of genetic diversity.
S			1.18.4.2.1.4	Two sources of information, used to varying extents in different species, "tell" a cell which genes to express at any given time during embryonic development.
S			1.38.2.2.2.6	Production of enormous numbers of seeds compensates for the odds against individual survival and gives natural selection ample genetic variations to screen.
S			1.17.5.5.2	These changes, called mutations, are responsible for the huge diversity of genes found among organisms because mutations are the ultimate source of new genes.
S			1.13.5.11.4	Mutations are the original source of this variation; the production of new combinations of variant genes in sexual reproduction generates additional genetic diversity.
S			1.27.2.2.1.1	Although new mutations are a major source of variation in prokaryotic populations, additional diversity arises from genetic recombination, the combining of DNA from two sources.

Q	Since DNA had not yet been discovered, how was Mendel able to determine how traits are passed from parents to offspring?
A	"By comparing phenotypic ratios"
S			1.15.3.2.1.1.1	Mendel learned from crosses in which he followed two characters that some offspring have combinations of traits that do not match those of either parent.
S			1.13.1.1.3.1	The transmission of hereditary traits has its molecular basis in the precise replication of DNA, which produces copies of genes that can be passed from parents to offspring.
S			1.16.3.16.1	In this chapter, you have learned how DNA molecules are arranged in chromosomes and how DNA replication provides the copies of genes that parents pass to offspring.
S			1.5.5.5.1.3	The linear sequences of nucleotides in DNA molecules are passed from parents to offspring; these sequences determine the amino acid sequences of proteins.
S			1.53.4.2.12.3	Primates generally bear only one or two offspring at a time; parental care and an extended period of learning in the first several years of life are very important to offspring fitness.
S			1.15.3.1.12.2	To understand this conclusion, we need to further explore genetic recombination, the production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either parent.
S			1.14.4.3.1.1.6	As with other dominant traits, a child born to a parent with the Huntington's disease allele has a 50% chance of inheriting the allele and the disorder (see the Punnett square in Figure 14.17).
S			1.1.1.6.2.4	DNA is the substance of genes, the units of inheritance that transmit information from parents to offspring.
S			1.14.3.4.3.1	Considering all that can occur in the pathway from genotype to phenotype, it is indeed impressive that Mendel could uncover the fundamental principles governing the transmission of individual genes from parents to offspring.

A	"Recessive"
S			4.1111.1.1	A complete dominant allele is a dominance in genetics is a relationship between two variant forms (alleles) of a single gene, in which one allele masks the expression of the other in influencing some trait.
S			1.20.4.4.8.1	Genes conferring useful traits, such as pest resistance, herbicide resistance, delayed ripening, and increased nutritional value, can be transferred from one plant variety or species to another using the Ti plasmid as a vector.
S			1.14.1.2.10.1	The "heritable factor" for the recessive trait (white flowers) had not been destroyed, deleted, or "blended" in the F1 generation but was merely masked by the presence of the factor for purple flowers, which is the dominant trait.
S			1.13.1.1.2.5	Most genes program cells to synthesize specific enzymes and other proteins, whose cumulative action produces an organism's inherited traits.
S			1.15.2.3.1.7	The tortoiseshell gene is on the X chromosome, and the tortoiseshell phenotype requires the presence of two different alleles, one for orange fur and one for black fur.
S			4.2167.1.2	A gene with multiple alleles has more than one form, and each form encodes a different version of a trait.
S			1.21.5.1.1.6	As long as one copy of an essential gene is expressed, the divergence of another copy can lead to its encoded protein acting in a novel way, thereby changing the organism's phenotype.
S			1.14.3.1.1.2.1	For some genes, however, neither allele is completely dominant, and the F1 hybrids have a phenotype somewhere between those of the two parental varieties.
S			1.14.5.52.2	In a short essay (100-150 words), explain how the passage of genes from parents to offspring, in the form of particular alleles, ensures perpetuation of parental traits in offspring and, at the same time, genetic variation among offspring.
S			1.14.4.3.2.5	Like the presence of extra fingers or toes mentioned earlier, achondroplasia is a trait for which the recessive allele is much more prevalent than the corresponding dominant allele.

Q	According to blending inheritance, if two organisms of a species produce offspring, the offspring should have what kind of traits relative to the parents?
A	"Intermediate"
S			1.17.1.3.3.6.1	In a research article about alkaptonuria published in 1902, Garrod suggested that humans inherit two "characters" (alleles) for a particular enzyme and that both parents must contribute a faulty version for the offspring to have the disorder.
S			1.24.5.8.1	Many groups of organisms form hybrid zones in which members of different species meet and mate, producing at least some offspring of mixed ancestry.
S			1.24.5.67.2	In a short essay (100-150 words), apply this idea to what occurs when organisms of two species that have homologous chromosomes mate and produce (F1) hybrid offspring.
S			1.33.3.1.3.4	The offspring often produce their own buds before detaching from the parent, thereby forming a chain of two to four genetically identical individuals: hence their informal name, "chain worms.
S			1.22.2.2.2.3.10	Inference #1: Individuals whose inherited traits give them a higher probability of surviving and reproducing in a given environment tend to leave more offspring than other individuals.
S			1.14.0.0.2.1	The explanation of heredity most widely in favor during the 1800s was the "blending" hypothesis, the idea that genetic material contributed by the two parents mixes in a manner analogous to the way blue and yellow paints blend to make green.
S			1.15.3.2.3.2.2	If the traits conferred by particular combinations of alleles are better suited for a given environment, organisms possessing those genotypes will be expected to thrive and leave more offspring, ensuring the continuation of their genetic complement.
S			1.13.1.1.3.1	The transmission of hereditary traits has its molecular basis in the precise replication of DNA, which produces copies of genes that can be passed from parents to offspring.
S			1.13.1.2.3.1	In sexual reproduction, two parents give rise to offspring that have unique combinations of genes inherited from the two parents.
S			1.14.4.2.1.5.4	Because people with recent common ancestors are more likely to carry the same recessive alleles than are unrelated people, it is more likely that a mating of close relatives will produce offspring homozygous for recessive traits: including harmful ones.

Q	Over time, what would be the effect of blending inheritance on diversity amongst individuals in a species?
A	"Decrease"
S			1.24.3.2.3.4.2	But whether our predictions are upheld or not, events in hybrid zones can shed light on how barriers to reproduction between closely related species change over time.
S			1.16.2.4.2.6	The balance between complete fidelity of DNA replication or repair and a low mutation rate has, over long periods of time, allowed the evolution of the rich diversity of species we see on Earth today.
S			1.56.1.1.2.1.1	Public awareness of the biodiversity crisis centers on species diversity: the variety of species in an ecosystem or across the biosphere (see Chapter 54).
S			1.1.2.8.1	In addition to encompassing a hierarchy of size scales from molecules to the biosphere, biology extends across the great diversity of species that have ever lived on Earth.
S			1.54.6.8.6	Humans are the most widespread agents of disturbance, and their effects on communities often reduce species diversity.
S			1.54.4.1.2.2	Over the course of evolutionary time, species richness may increase in a community as more speciation events occur (see Chapter 24).
S			1.22.3.3.4.4	In each of these cases, the fossil record shows that over time, descent with modification produced increasingly large differences among related groups of organisms, ultimately resulting in the diversity of life we see today.
S			1.13.2.3.2.1	Although the alternation of meiosis and fertilization is common to all organisms that reproduce sexually, the timing of these two events in the life cycle varies, depending on the species.
S			1.54.4.3.16.3	Nonetheless, the model is widely applied in conservation biology, particularly for the design of habitat reserves and for providing a starting point for predicting the effects of habitat loss on species diversity.
S			1.14.1.1.13.3	Had Mendel focused instead on characters that varied in a continuum among individuals: seed weight, for example: he would not have discovered the particulate nature of inheritance.

Q	How does linkage affect how different traits are inherited?
A	"Segregation into gametes is not always random"
S			1.15.3.1.1.1	To see how linkage between genes affects the inheritance of two different characters, let's examine another of Morgan's Drosophila experiments.
S			1.23.1.9.2	He observed that individuals differed in their inherited traits and that selection acted on such differences, leading to evolutionary change.
S			1.14.1.2.13.1	Mendel observed the same pattern of inheritance in six other characters, each represented by two distinctly different traits (Table 14.1).
S			4.2615.1.4	Mendel concluded that different traits are inherited independently of each other, so that there is no relation, for example, between a cat's color and tail length.
S			1.14.4.1.1.5	The two traits have different inheritance patterns, as seen by analysis of the pedigrees.
S			4.5490.1.1	A form of X chromosome linked inheritance whereby the male parent is dominant for the inherited trait.
S			4.5496.1.1	A form of X chromosome linked inheritance whereby the male parent is recessive for the inherited trait.
S			4.5492.1.1	A form of X chromosome linked inheritance whereby the female parent is homozygous dominant for the inherited trait.
S			4.5494.1.1	A form of X chromosome linked inheritance whereby the female parent is homozygous recessive for the inherited trait.
S			1.15.2.2.3.6	For instance, color blindness is a mild disorder almost always inherited as an X-linked trait.

Q	How are the alleles for two separate traits inherited relative to each other when they are on separate chromosomes?
A	"Randomly"
S			1.14.3.10.2	For the work that led to his two laws of inheritance, Mendel chose pea plant characters that turn out to have a relatively simple genetic basis: Each character is determined by one gene, for which there are only two alleles, one completely dominant and the other completely recessive.
S			1.15.3.1.8.2	However, the production of a relatively small number of offspring with nonparental phenotypes indicated that some mechanism occasionally breaks the linkage between specific alleles of genes on the same chromosome.
S			1.21.5.2.4.6	Thus, chromosomal rearrangements would lead to two populations that could not successfully mate with each other, a step on the way to their becoming two separate species.
S			1.14.4.1.4.9	Assuming that the genes for these two characters are on different chromosomes, the two pairs of alleles will assort independently in this dihybrid cross (WwFf * WwFf).
S			1.14.3.1.1.4.1	Another variation on dominance relationships between alleles is called codominance; in this variation, the two alleles each affect the phenotype in separate, distinguishable ways.
S			1.15.3.1.11.2	Morgan thus concluded that body color and wing size are usually inherited together in specific (parental) combinations because the genes for these characters are near each other on the same chromosome:
S			1.14.1.2.1.5.1	The fourth and final part of Mendel's model, the law of segregation, states that the two alleles for a heritable character segregate (separate from each other) during gamete formation and end up in different gametes.
S			1.1.1.6.1.2.1	The DNA of chromosomes replicates as a cell prepares to divide, and each of the two cellular offspring inherits a complete set of genes, identical to that of the parent cell.
S			1.15.2.3.1.7	The tortoiseshell gene is on the X chromosome, and the tortoiseshell phenotype requires the presence of two different alleles, one for orange fur and one for black fur.
S			1.23.5.8.1	In natural selection, individuals that have certain inherited traits tend to survive and reproduce at higher rates than other individuals because of those traits.

Q	How would the alleles for two separate traits be inherited relative to each other if Mendel had chosen two traits that happened to be more than 50 cM away from each other on the same chromosome?
A	"Randomly"
S			1.14.3.10.2	For the work that led to his two laws of inheritance, Mendel chose pea plant characters that turn out to have a relatively simple genetic basis: Each character is determined by one gene, for which there are only two alleles, one completely dominant and the other completely recessive.
S			1.14.3.1.1.1	The inheritance of characters determined by a single gene deviates from simple Mendelian patterns when alleles are not completely dominant or recessive, when a particular gene has more than two alleles, or when a single gene produces multiple phenotypes.
S			1.23.5.8.1	In natural selection, individuals that have certain inherited traits tend to survive and reproduce at higher rates than other individuals because of those traits.
S			1.14.1.2.1.5.1	The fourth and final part of Mendel's model, the law of segregation, states that the two alleles for a heritable character segregate (separate from each other) during gamete formation and end up in different gametes.
S			1.22.2.1.2.2.7	As we'll explore further, his explanation of how adaptations arise centered on natural selection, a process in which individuals that have certain inherited traits tend to survive and reproduce at higher rates than other individuals because of those traits.
S			1.15.3.1.8.2	However, the production of a relatively small number of offspring with nonparental phenotypes indicated that some mechanism occasionally breaks the linkage between specific alleles of genes on the same chromosome.
S			1.15.3.3.13.6	In fact, at least two of the genes for pea characters that Mendel studied are now known to be on the same chromosome, but the distance between them is so great that linkage is not observed in genetic crosses.
S			1.22.2.2.2.3.10	Inference #1: Individuals whose inherited traits give them a higher probability of surviving and reproducing in a given environment tend to leave more offspring than other individuals.
S			1.14.4.2.1.5.4	Because people with recent common ancestors are more likely to carry the same recessive alleles than are unrelated people, it is more likely that a mating of close relatives will produce offspring homozygous for recessive traits: including harmful ones.
S			1.14.3.1.1.4.1	Another variation on dominance relationships between alleles is called codominance; in this variation, the two alleles each affect the phenotype in separate, distinguishable ways.

Q	For two traits that are more than 50 cM away from each other, how are they inherited relative to each other?
A	"Randomly"
S			1.14.3.10.2	For the work that led to his two laws of inheritance, Mendel chose pea plant characters that turn out to have a relatively simple genetic basis: Each character is determined by one gene, for which there are only two alleles, one completely dominant and the other completely recessive.
S			1.22.2.2.2.3.10	Inference #1: Individuals whose inherited traits give them a higher probability of surviving and reproducing in a given environment tend to leave more offspring than other individuals.
S			1.14.3.1.1.1	The inheritance of characters determined by a single gene deviates from simple Mendelian patterns when alleles are not completely dominant or recessive, when a particular gene has more than two alleles, or when a single gene produces multiple phenotypes.

S			1.27.1.1.7.3	Fimbriae are usually shorter and more numerous than pili (singular, pilus), appendages that pull two cells together prior to DNA transfer from one cell to the other (see Figure 27.12); pili are sometimes referred to as sex pili.
S			1.30.3.1.1.1.2	In many angiosperm species, insects or other animals transfer pollen from one flower to the sex organs on another flower, which makes pollination more directed than the wind-dependent pollination of most gymnosperms.
S			1.22.3.3.4.2	These discoveries also show that cetaceans and their close living relatives (hippopotamuses, pigs, deer, and other even-toed ungulates) are much more different from each other than were Pakicetus and early even-toed ungulates, such as Diacodexis.
S			1.22.2.1.2.2.7	As we'll explore further, his explanation of how adaptations arise centered on natural selection, a process in which individuals that have certain inherited traits tend to survive and reproduce at higher rates than other individuals because of those traits.

Q	Why are two traits that are more than 50cM away from each other inherited randomly relative to each other?
A	"High recombination frequency"	"High crossover rate"
S			1.14.3.10.2	For the work that led to his two laws of inheritance, Mendel chose pea plant characters that turn out to have a relatively simple genetic basis: Each character is determined by one gene, for which there are only two alleles, one completely dominant and the other completely recessive.
S			1.22.2.2.2.3.10	Inference #1: Individuals whose inherited traits give them a higher probability of surviving and reproducing in a given environment tend to leave more offspring than other individuals.

S			1.31.2.1.2.6	In other species, the haploid nuclei pair off two to a cell, one from each parent.

Q	Are sister chromatids usually identical or non-identical with respect to the alleles they carry?
A	"Identical"
S			1.13.4.1.2.4.1	At metaphase II, chromosomes that contain one or more recombinant chromatids can be oriented in two alternative, nonequivalent ways with respect to other chromosomes, because their sister chromatids are no longer identical.
S			4.2919.1.5	Diploid and polyploid cells whose chromosomes have the same allele of a given gene at some locus are called homozygous with respect to that gene, while those that have different alleles of a given gene at a locus, heterozygous with respect to that gene.
S			1.14.4.2.1.5.4	Because people with recent common ancestors are more likely to carry the same recessive alleles than are unrelated people, it is more likely that a mating of close relatives will produce offspring homozygous for recessive traits: including harmful ones.
S			4.4649.1.2	Sister chromatids contain the same genes and same alleles, and homologous chromosomes contain the same genes but two copies of alleles, each of which might or might not be the same as each other.
S			1.14.4.2.3.3.5	Thus, in tropical Africa, where infection with the malaria parasite is common, the sickle-cell allele confers an advantage to heterozygotes even though it is harmful in the homozygous state.
S			1.14.4.2.1.2.6	Although phenotypically normal with regard to the disorder, heterozygotes may transmit the recessive allele to their offspring and thus are called carriers.
S			1.12.1.2.2.3	Each sister chromatid has a centromere, a region containing specific DNA sequences where the chromatid is attached most closely to its sister chromatid.
S			1.15.1.1.2.2.2	The correlation between the trait of white eye color and the male sex of the affected F2 flies suggested to Morgan that the gene involved in his white-eyed mutant was located exclusively on the X chromosome, with no corresponding allele present on the Y chromosome.
S			4.922.1.1	A chiasma in genetics, is thought to be the point where two homologous non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material during chromosomal crossover during meiosis.
S			1.14.4.3.1.2.2	By analyzing DNA samples from a large family with a high incidence of the disorder, geneticists tracked the Huntington's allele to a locus near the tip of chromosome 4, and the gene was sequenced in 1993.

Q	What is the effect of a chromosomal crossover event between sister chromatids?
A	"No effect"
S			1.13.3.2.4.5	In metaphase I, homologs are held together by cohesion between sister chromatid arms in regions beyond points of crossing over, where stretches of sister chromatids now belong to different chromosomes.
S			1.15.3.3.2.2	He assumed that crossing over is a random event, with the chance of crossing over approximately equal at all points along a chromosome.
S			1.15.3.2.2.2.1	Faced with these results, Morgan proposed that some process must occasionally break the physical connection between specific alleles of genes on the same chromosome.
S			1.13.5.11.2	Crossing over involves breakage and rejoining of the DNA of nonsister chromatids in a homologous pair, resulting in recombinant chromatids that will become recombinant chromosomes.
S			1.13.3.2.4.10	Thus, sister chromatid cohesion and crossing over, acting together, play an essential role in the lining up of chromosomes by homologous pairs at metaphase I.
S			1.13.4.1.2.2.4	In meiosis in humans, an average of one to three crossover events occur per chromosome pair, depending on the size of the chromosomes and the position of their centromeres.
S			1.15.3.3.13.4	In this case, the physical connection between genes on the same chromosome is not reflected in the results of genetic crosses.
S			1.21.5.3.2.2	Unequal crossing over during prophase I of meiosis, for instance, can result in one chromosome with a deletion and another with a duplication of a particular gene.
S			1.23.5.4.4	In sexually reproducing organisms, most of the genetic differences among individuals result from crossing over, the independent assortment of chromosomes, and fertilization.
S			1.13.3.2.4.6	As shown in Figure 13.8, the combination of crossing over and sister chromatid cohesion along the arms results in the formation of a chiasma.

Q	How many non-identical chromatids result from a crossover between a pair of sister chromatids?
A	"0"	"Zero"
S			4.2396.1.3	For example, a woman who is a heterozygote for cystic fibrosis (CF) carries the CF gene on one of her chromosomes number 7 and the normal paired (non-CF) gene at the same position on her other chromosome 7.
S			4.922.1.1	A chiasma in genetics, is thought to be the point where two homologous non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material during chromosomal crossover during meiosis.
S			1.13.4.1.2.3.3	In a single crossover event, the DNA of two nonsister chromatids: one maternal and one paternal chromatid of a homologous pair: is broken by specific proteins at precisely corresponding points, and the two segments beyond the crossover point are each joined to the other chromatid.
S			1.15.3.3.13.3	The observed frequency of recombination in crosses involving two such genes can have a maximum value of 50%, a result indistinguishable from that for genes on different chromosomes.
S			1.15.0.0.2.3	For example, the four yellow dots in Figure 15.1 mark the locus of a specific gene on the sister chromatids of a homologous pair of replicated human chromosomes.
S			1.13.4.1.2.2.4	In meiosis in humans, an average of one to three crossover events occur per chromosome pair, depending on the size of the chromosomes and the position of their centromeres.
S			1.15.3.3.13.8	Genes located far apart on a chromosome are mapped by adding the recombination frequencies from crosses involving closer pairs of genes lying between the two distant genes.
S			4.1397.1.1	A mutational loss of one or more nucleotide pairs from a gene.
S			4.3646.1.1	A pairing of homologous chromosomes is an event where corresponding chromosomes, one from each parent, pair together during metaphase I of meiosis.
S			1.12.2.2.11.1	Then they marked a region of the kinetochore microtubules between one spindle pole and the chromosomes by using a laser to eliminate the fluorescence from that region, while leaving the microtubules intact (see below).

Q	Why can crossover occur during meiosis?
A	"Homologous chromosomes line up"	"Homologous chromosomes are connected"
S			1.21.5.3.2.2	Unequal crossing over during prophase I of meiosis, for instance, can result in one chromosome with a deletion and another with a duplication of a particular gene.
S			1.21.5.4.2.1	We've already seen that unequal crossing over during meiosis can lead to duplication of a gene on one chromosome and its loss from the homologous chromosome (see Figure 21.13).
S			1.13.4.1.2.4.2	The different possible arrangements of nonidentical sister chromatids during meiosis II further increase the number of genetic types of daughter cells that can result from meiosis.
S			4.922.1.1	A chiasma in genetics, is thought to be the point where two homologous non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material during chromosomal crossover during meiosis.
S			1.15.1.5.1	Figure 15.2 shows that the behavior of homologous chromosomes during meiosis can account for the segregation of the alleles at each genetic locus to different gametes.
S			1.21.5.3.2.1	Errors during meiosis can also lead to the duplication of chromosomal regions that are smaller than the ones we've just discussed, including segments the length of individual genes.
S			1.15.1.5.3	By carefully studying this figure, which traces the same dihybrid pea cross you learned about in Figure 14.8, you can see how the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis in the F1 generation and subsequent random fertilization give rise to the F2 phenotypic ratio observed by Mendel.
S			1.13.3.2.3.1	Three events unique to meiosis occur during meiosis I: Synapsis and crossing over.
S			1.23.1.2.2.2.1	An important source of variation begins when genes are duplicated due to errors in meiosis (such as unequal crossing over), slippage during DNA replication, or the activities of transposable elements (see Chapters 15 and 21).
S			1.15.6.9.4	For genetically linked genes, crossing over between nonsister chromatids during meiosis I accounts for the observed recombinants, always less than 50% of the total.

Q	How many genetically non-identical daughter cells can result from the meiosis of one pair of homologous chromosomes, assuming one crossover event?
A	"4"
S			1.31.4.4.6.2	In Neurospora, for example, many dikaryotic cells can develop into asci, recombining genomes during meiosis and resulting in a multitude of genetically different offspring from one mating event (see steps 2 and 3 in Figure 31.17).
S			1.13.4.1.1.2.1	Because each pair of homologous chromosomes is positioned independently of the other pairs at metaphase I, the first meiotic division results in each pair sorting its maternal and paternal homologs into daughter cells independently of every other pair.
S			1.13.4.1.1.2.5	Note that only two of the four combinations of daughter cells shown in the figure would result from meiosis of a single diploid cell, because a single parent cell would have one or the other possible chromosomal arrangement at metaphase I, but not both.
S			1.13.3.1.2.1	The overview of meiosis in Figure 13.7 shows, for a single pair of homologous chromosomes in a diploid cell, that both members of the pair are duplicated and the copies sorted into four haploid daughter cells.
S			4.3646.1.1	A pairing of homologous chromosomes is an event where corresponding chromosomes, one from each parent, pair together during metaphase I of meiosis.
S			1.21.5.4.2.1	We've already seen that unequal crossing over during meiosis can lead to duplication of a gene on one chromosome and its loss from the homologous chromosome (see Figure 21.13).
S			1.13.4.1.2.3.3	In a single crossover event, the DNA of two nonsister chromatids: one maternal and one paternal chromatid of a homologous pair: is broken by specific proteins at precisely corresponding points, and the two segments beyond the crossover point are each joined to the other chromatid.
S			1.13.5.11.1	Three events in sexual reproduction contribute to genetic variation in a population: independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis, crossing over during meiosis I, and random fertilization of egg cells by sperm.
S			4.3177.1.1	Mitosis is a cell division of somatic cells of Eukaryotic organisms which result in two daughter cells genetically identical (has same number of chromosomes as do their parent cell) to their parent cell
S			1.13.4.1.2.2.4	In meiosis in humans, an average of one to three crossover events occur per chromosome pair, depending on the size of the chromosomes and the position of their centromeres.

Q	How many non-identical daughter cells can result from the meiosis of two pairs of homologous chromosomes, assuming no crossover events?
A	"4"
S			1.13.4.1.1.2.1	Because each pair of homologous chromosomes is positioned independently of the other pairs at metaphase I, the first meiotic division results in each pair sorting its maternal and paternal homologs into daughter cells independently of every other pair.
S			1.13.4.1.1.2.5	Note that only two of the four combinations of daughter cells shown in the figure would result from meiosis of a single diploid cell, because a single parent cell would have one or the other possible chromosomal arrangement at metaphase I, but not both.
S			1.13.4.1.1.2.4	As shown in Figure 13.10, the number of combinations possible for daughter cells formed by meiosis of a diploid cell with n = 2 (two pairs of homologous chromosomes) is four: two possible arrangements for the first pair times two possible arrangements for the second pair.
S			1.31.4.4.6.2	In Neurospora, for example, many dikaryotic cells can develop into asci, recombining genomes during meiosis and resulting in a multitude of genetically different offspring from one mating event (see steps 2 and 3 in Figure 31.17).
S			1.13.4.1.2.3.3	In a single crossover event, the DNA of two nonsister chromatids: one maternal and one paternal chromatid of a homologous pair: is broken by specific proteins at precisely corresponding points, and the two segments beyond the crossover point are each joined to the other chromatid.
S			1.13.3.1.2.1	The overview of meiosis in Figure 13.7 shows, for a single pair of homologous chromosomes in a diploid cell, that both members of the pair are duplicated and the copies sorted into four haploid daughter cells.
S			4.3646.1.1	A pairing of homologous chromosomes is an event where corresponding chromosomes, one from each parent, pair together during metaphase I of meiosis.
S			1.21.5.4.2.1	We've already seen that unequal crossing over during meiosis can lead to duplication of a gene on one chromosome and its loss from the homologous chromosome (see Figure 21.13).
S			4.3177.1.1	Mitosis is a cell division of somatic cells of Eukaryotic organisms which result in two daughter cells genetically identical (has same number of chromosomes as do their parent cell) to their parent cell
S			1.13.4.1.1.1.4	Thus, there is a 50% chance that a particular daughter cell of meiosis I will get the maternal chromosome of a certain homologous pair and a 50% chance that it will get the paternal chromosome.

Q	How many chromosome pairs to humans have?
A	"23"
S			1.16.3.9.1	Using techniques you'll learn about in Chapter 20, researchers have been able to treat human chromosomes with special molecular tags, such that each chromosome pair can be seen as a different color.
S			1.21.5.2.4.5	Although two individuals with different arrangements could still mate and produce offspring, the offspring would have two nonequivalent sets of chromosomes, making meiosis inefficient or even impossible.
S			1.13.4.1.2.2.4	In meiosis in humans, an average of one to three crossover events occur per chromosome pair, depending on the size of the chromosomes and the position of their centromeres.
S			1.13.2.1.11.2	Human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes (XX), but males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).
S			1.1.1.6.2.1.2	A typical human cell has two similar sets of chromosomes, and each set has DNA totaling about 3 billion nucleotide pairs.
S			1.35.5.1.2.3	Furthermore, the plant has only five pairs of chromosomes, making it easier for geneticists to locate specific genes.
S			1.24.5.67.2	In a short essay (100-150 words), apply this idea to what occurs when organisms of two species that have homologous chromosomes mate and produce (F1) hybrid offspring.
S			4.2436.1.1	Homologous chromosome is one of the pair of chromosomes (termed as homologous chromosomes) which is genetically identical to its corresponding homologous chromosome by having same DNA sequence throughout their length
S			1.15.4.3.3.4.2	About 5% of individuals with Down syndrome have a chromosomal translocation in which a third copy of chromosome 21 is attached to chromosome 14.
S			1.15.6.11.7	Such alterations cause Down syndrome (usually due to trisomy of chromosome 21), certain cancers associated with chromosomal translocations, and various other human disorders.

Q	How many chromosomes are present in a human gamete?
A	"23"
S			1.13.4.1.3.1.2	In humans, each male and female gamete represents one of about 8.4 million (223) possible chromosome combinations due to independent assortment.
S			1.13.1.1.4.3	For example, humans have 46 chromosomes in their somatic cells: all cells of the body except the gametes and their precursors.
S			1.12.1.1.3.3	Reproductive cells, or gametes: sperm and eggs: have half as many chromosomes as somatic cells, or one set of 23 chromosomes in humans.
S			1.13.4.1.1.3.1	In the case of humans (n = 23), the number of possible combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes in the resulting gametes is 223, or about 8.4 million.
S			1.13.5.6.5	At sexual maturity in the human life cycle, ovaries and testes (the gonads) produce haploid gametes by meiosis, each gamete containing a single set of 23 chromosomes (n = 23).
S			1.12.1.2.4.8	Fertilization fuses two gametes together and returns the chromosome number to 46, and mitosis conserves that number in every somatic cell nucleus of the new individual.
S			1.24.4.1.2.6.1	At Indiana University, Loren Rieseberg and his colleagues crossed the two parent sunflower species, H. annuus and H. petiolaris, to produce experimental hybrids in the laboratory (for each gamete, only two of the n = 17 chromosomes are shown).
S			1.15.6.9.3	Because of the independent assortment of chromosomes, unlinked genes exhibit a 50% frequency of recombination in the gametes.
S			1.14.1.2.1.6.2	For the flower-color character, the model predicts that the two different alleles present in an F1 individual will segregate into gametes such that half the gametes will have the purple-flower allele and half will have the white-flower allele.
S			1.21.1.1.5.3	Even with automation, the sequencing of all 3 billion base pairs  in a haploid set of human chromosomes presented a formidable challenge.

Q	In humans, does the male or the female gamete determine gender?
A	"Male"
S			1.46.4.1.1.1	Upon reaching sexual maturity, human males carry out gametogenesis continuously, whereas human females produce gametes in cycles.
S			1.13.2.2.2.1	The only cells of the human body not produced by mitosis are the gametes, which develop from specialized cells called germ cells in the gonads: ovaries in females and testes in males (Figure 13.5).
S			4.2385.1.1	Hermaphroditism is a condition in which an individual has both female and male gonads and functions as both a male and female in sexual reproduction by producing both sperm and eggs.
S			1.33.5.1.2.5	Sexual reproduction of echinoderms usually involves separate male and female individuals that release their gametes into the water.
S			1.13.4.1.3.1.2	In humans, each male and female gamete represents one of about 8.4 million (223) possible chromosome combinations due to independent assortment.
S			1.28.3.2.4.1.3	Although haploid and diploid conditions alternate in all sexual life cycles: human gametes, for example, are haploid: the term alternation of generations applies only to life cycles in which both haploid and diploid stages are multicellular.
S			1.46.4.3.3.1	The general pattern of human sexual response is similar in males and females.
S			4.2278.1.1	A gonad is the male and female sex organs; the gamete-producing organs in most animals.
S			1.46.1.4.3.3	Since the number of gametes produced generally increases with size much more for females than for males, sex reversal in this direction maximizes gamete production.
S			1.46.2.2.3.8	Because the female releases male gametes from the spermatheca only in response to the appropriate stimuli, fertilization occurs under conditions likely to be well suited to embryonic development.

Q	Can acquired traits be passed on to offspring?
A	"No"
S			1.13.1.1.3.1	The transmission of hereditary traits has its molecular basis in the precise replication of DNA, which produces copies of genes that can be passed from parents to offspring.
S			4.736.1.2	The heterozygote is phenotypically dominant for the character determined by the gene but can pass on the recessive allele to offspring.
S			4.2816.1.1	The Lamarck's theory of Evolution is the idea that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring (also known as heritability of acquired characteristics).
S			1.1.2.2.4.3	He started with the following three observations from nature: First, individuals in a population vary in their traits, many of which seem to be heritable (passed on from parents to offspring).
S			1.51.4.4.3.4	This idea led to Hamilton's idea of inclusive fitness, the total effect an individual has on proliferating its genes by producing its own offspring and by providing aid that enables other close relatives, who share many of those genes, to produce offspring.
S			1.23.1.2.1.1.3	In multicellular organisms, only mutations in cell lines that produce gametes can be passed to offspring.
S			1.15.0.0.2.4	This chapter extends what you learned in the past two chapters: We describe the chromosomal basis for the transmission of genes from parents to offspring, along with some important exceptions to the standard mode of inheritance.
S			1.51.5.10.7	This behavior can be explained by the concept of inclusive fitness, the total effect an individual has on proliferating its genes by producing its own offspring and by providing aid that enables close relatives to produce offspring.
S			1.21.6.2.1.2	Their aim is to understand how these processes have evolved and how changes in them can modify existing organismal features or lead to new ones.
S			1.34.6.3.2.4.4	Despite their lack of legs, snakes are quite proficient at moving on land, most often by producing waves of lateral bending that pass from head to tail.

Q	What does an allele frequency measure?
A	"Proportion of an allele in a population"
S			1.23.5.57.2	They measured the frequency of a particular allele (lap94) for an enzyme involved in regulating the mussel's internal saltwater balance.
S			1.23.3.2.2.4	Perhaps a large animal such as a moose stepped on the three CWCW individuals in generation 2, killing them and increasing the chance that only the CR allele would be passed to the next generation.
S			1.23.3.2.4.1.4	Genetic drift can cause allele frequencies to change at random.
S			1.23.2.2.2.1.12	By moving alleles into or out of populations, gene flow can alter allele frequencies.
S			1.23.3.2.2.5	Allele frequencies can also be affected by chance events that occur during fertilization.
S			1.23.4.1	23.3 Natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow can alter allele frequencies in a population
S			1.23.2.2.3.17.1	23.3 Natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow can alter allele frequencies in a population
S			1.23.5.68.1	23.3 Natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow can alter allele frequencies in a population
S			1.23.3.2.4.1.8	By causing allele frequencies to fluctuate randomly over time, genetic drift can eliminate alleles from a population.
S			1.23.2.1.7.1	Next we'll see how allele and genotype frequencies can be used to test whether evolution is occurring in a population.

Q	What is a case in which inheritance is only from the mother?
A	"Mitochondrial DNA"
S			4.5137.1.4	In humans, as in most multicellular organisms, mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother's ovum.
S			1.15.6.13.3	The inheritance of traits controlled by the genes present in mitochondria and plastids depends solely on the maternal parent because the zygote's cytoplasm containing these organelles comes from the egg.
S			1.18.5.4.2.7	Since only 15% of colorectal cancers are associated with known inherited mutations, researchers continue in their efforts to identify "markers" that could predict the risk of developing this type of cancer.
S			1.14.4.5.3.6.1	Ultrasound and isolation of fetal cells or DNA from maternal blood pose no known risk to either mother or fetus, while the other procedures can cause complications in a small percentage of cases.
S			1.14.1.3.1.1	Mendel derived the law of segregation from experiments in which he followed only a single character, such as flower color.
S			1.14.2.2.5.3	Next, we calculate the probability for each of these genotypes resulting from our PpYyRr * Ppyyrr cross by multiplying together the individual probabilities for the allele pairs, just as we did in our dihybrid example.
S			1.14.4.2.1.2.5	Thus, a recessively inherited disorder shows up only in the homozygous individuals (aa) who inherit one recessive allele from each parent.
S			1.15.5.1.2.2	Because these genes are imprinted differently in sperm and eggs, a zygote expresses only one allele of an imprinted gene, that inherited from either the female or the male parent.
S			1.38.3.3.3.2.7	Chloroplast DNA in many plant species is inherited strictly from the egg, so transgenes in the chloroplast cannot be transferred by pollen (see Chapter 15 to review maternal inheritance).
S			1.15.5.2.3.1	Similar maternal inheritance is also the rule for mitochondrial genes in most animals and plants, because almost all the mitochondria passed on to a zygote come from the cytoplasm of the egg.

Q	How is mitochondrial DNA only inherited from the mother?
A	"The maternal gamete has mitochondria"	"Paternal gamete mtDNA does not enter egg"	"Paternal gamete mtDNA is degraded"	"Paternal gamete mtDNA is diluted out"
S			4.5137.1.4	In humans, as in most multicellular organisms, mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother's ovum.
S			1.15.6.13.3	The inheritance of traits controlled by the genes present in mitochondria and plastids depends solely on the maternal parent because the zygote's cytoplasm containing these organelles comes from the egg.
S			1.15.5.2.3.1	Similar maternal inheritance is also the rule for mitochondrial genes in most animals and plants, because almost all the mitochondria passed on to a zygote come from the cytoplasm of the egg.
S			1.38.3.3.3.2.7	Chloroplast DNA in many plant species is inherited strictly from the egg, so transgenes in the chloroplast cannot be transferred by pollen (see Chapter 15 to review maternal inheritance).
S			1.34.8.7.6.5	Mitochondrial DNA sequences were also obtained for a number of living humans from Europe, Africa, and Asia.
S			1.15.6.14.1	Explain how genomic imprinting and inheritance of mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA are exceptions to standard Mendelian inheritance.
S			1.25.3.1.2.4.5	As might be expected of organelles descended from free-living organisms, mitochondria and plastids also have the cellular machinery (including ribosomes) needed to transcribe and translate their DNA into proteins.
S			1.34.8.7.6.4	The team extracted mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from a Neanderthal fossil (Neanderthal 1) and compared its sequence to an mtDNA sequence that other researchers had obtained three years earlier from a different Neanderthal fossil (Neanderthal 2).
S			1.20.3.2.1.10.2	(Her mitochondrial DNA came from the egg donor, as expected. )
S			1.56.1.3.3.3.4	Similarly, biologists using phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) showed that some whale meat sold in Japanese fish markets came from illegally harvested species, including fin and humpback whales, which are endangered (see Figure 26.6).

Q	Why does color blindness usually affect men, not women?
A	"Men have only one X chromosome"	"Women have two X chromosomes"
S			1.50.3.2.4.3.3	For this reason, color blindness is more common in males than in females (5-8% of males, fewer than 1% of females) and nearly always disrupts perception of red or green (the gene for blue pigment is on human chromosome 7).
S			1.15.2.2.3.8	Because the X-linked allele for color blindness is relatively rare, though, the probability that such a man and woman will mate is low.
S			1.50.3.2.4.4.1	Color blindness is also more common among males than females in squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), providing a good experimental model for studying this disorder.
S			1.49.5.2.1.4	One of the most common nervous system disorders, major depression affects about one in every seven adults at some point, and twice as many women as men.
S			1.18.5.4.3.2	This is the second most common type of cancer in the United States, striking over 180,000 women (and some men) annually and killing 40,000 each year.
S			1.50.3.2.4.12.1	Red-green color blindness is X-linked in squirrel monkeys and humans (see Figure 15.7, p. 291).
S			1.15.2.2.4.1	A number of human X-linked disorders are much more serious than color blindness.
S			1.50.3.2.4.1.4	Cats, for instance, are usually most active at night; they have limited color vision and probably see a pastel world during the day.
S			1.14.0.0.1.1	If you spotted a woman with bright purple hair walking down the street, you would probably deduce that she hadn't inherited her striking hair color from either parent.
S			1.15.6.24.3	A color-blind man marries a woman with normal vision whose father was color-blind.

Q	Why are deleterious alleles that are dominant less common that deleterious recessive alleles?
A	"They decrease fitness in all organisms with the allele"	"Natural selection weeds them out more quickly"	"Natural selection acts on them more quickly"
S			1.14.4.3.3.1	Dominant alleles that cause a lethal disease are much less common than recessive alleles that have lethal effects.
S			1.23.4.4.1.1.2	Recessive alleles that are less favorable than their dominant counterparts, or even harmful in the current environment, can persist by propagation in heterozygous individuals.
S			1.14.3.1.1.9.1	Although you might assume that the dominant allele for a particular character would be more common in a population than the recessive allele, this is not a given.
S			1.14.1.3.2.4	From single-character crosses, Mendel knew that the allele for yellow seeds is dominant (Y), and the allele for green seeds is recessive (y).
S			1.14.4.3.2.1	Although many harmful alleles are recessive, a number of human disorders are due to dominant alleles.
S			1.14.4.2.1.5.4	Because people with recent common ancestors are more likely to carry the same recessive alleles than are unrelated people, it is more likely that a mating of close relatives will produce offspring homozygous for recessive traits: including harmful ones.
S			1.15.2.2.1.3	The superscript N represents the dominant allele for normal color vision carried on the X chromosome, and the superscript n represents the recessive allele, which has a mutation causing color blindness.
S			1.14.5.39.3	At a different locus, the dominant allele P causes purple kernel color, while the homozygous recessive genotype pp causes red kernels.
S			1.14.5.14.3	When represented by single letters, the dominant allele is uppercase and the recessive is lowercase.
S			1.14.3.1.1.1	The inheritance of characters determined by a single gene deviates from simple Mendelian patterns when alleles are not completely dominant or recessive, when a particular gene has more than two alleles, or when a single gene produces multiple phenotypes.

Q	How does the gene for sickle cell anemia show heterozygote advantage?
A	"Heterozygotes more resistant to malarial infections"
S			1.14.4.2.3.3.5	Thus, in tropical Africa, where infection with the malaria parasite is common, the sickle-cell allele confers an advantage to heterozygotes even though it is harmful in the homozygous state.
S			1.20.2.1.13.8	Figure 20.11 outlines the entire procedure and demonstrates how it can differentiate a heterozygote (in this case, for the sickle-cell allele) from an individual homozygous for the normal allele.
S			1.23.4.4.2.3.7	The sickle-cell allele is most common in Africa, but it is not the only case of heterozygote advantage providing protection against malaria.
S			4.4612.1.1	A sickle-cell anemia is an autosomal recessive genetic blood disorder characterized by red blood cells that assume an abnormal, rigid, sickle shape.
S			1.23.4.4.2.3.1	An example of heterozygote advantage occurs at the locus in humans that codes for the beta polypeptide subunit of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein of red blood cells.
S			1.1.4.3.7.1	The gene that causes sickle-cell disease is present in a higher percentage of residents of sub- Saharan Africa than it is among those of African descent living in the United States.
S			1.20.2.1.12.2	Consequently, while other assays are preferred today, restriction fragment analysis was used for many years to distinguish the normal and sickle-cell alleles of the beta-globin gene, as shown in Figure 20.10.
S			1.23.1.2.1.2.1	A change of as little as one base in a gene, called a "point mutation," can have a significant impact on phenotype, as in sickle-cell disease (see Figure 17.23).
S			1.14.4.2.3.3.1	About one out of ten African-Americans have sickle-cell trait, an unusually high frequency of heterozygotes for an allele with severe detrimental effects in homozygotes.
S			1.20.2.1.19.1	In this example, we compare genomic DNA samples from three individuals: a homozygote for the normal beta-globin allele (I), a homozygote for the mutant sickle-cell allele (II), and a heterozygote (III).

Q	Why are there so few Y-linked disease?
A	"It has few genes"	"It is short"	"There is no genetic recombination"
S			1.15.2.1.5.5	Because there are so few Y-linked genes, very few disorders are transferred from father to son on the Y chromosome.
S			1.49.4.1.5.1	Although the underlying causes of autism are unknown, there is a strong genetic contribution to this and related disorders.
S			1.49.5.4.4.5	There is evidence that changes in tau are associated with the appearance of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, a much less common disorder that affects relatively young individuals.
S			1.15.2.2.3.5	However, even though the chance of a female inheriting a double dose of the mutant allele is much less than the probability of a male inheriting a single dose, there are females with X-linked disorders.
S			1.38.2.1.3.3	This asexual production of seeds is called apomixis (from the Greek words meaning "away from the act of mixing") because there is no joining or, indeed, production of sperm and egg.
S			1.21.6.1.1.2.3	As a case in point, several genes in yeast are so similar to certain human disease genes that researchers have deduced the functions of the disease genes by studying their yeast counterparts.
S			1.15.2.1.2.3	In humans and other mammals, there are two varieties of sex chromosomes, designated X and Y. The Y chromosome is much smaller than the X chromosome (Figure 15.5).
S			1.2.1.2.3.2	In humans, for instance, the element arsenic has been linked to numerous diseases and can be lethal.
S			1.47.3.2.3.3.3	Mutations that block the function of monocilia have also been linked to cystic kidney disease in humans.
S			1.20.4.1.1.3.1	As you learned earlier, genome-wide association studies have pinpointed SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that are linked to disease-causing alleles.

Q	Why are X-linked genes never passed from father to son?
A	"Fathers give sons Y-chromosome"
S			1.15.2.2.2.4	In contrast, mothers can pass X-linked alleles to both sons and daughters, as shown in Figure 15.7.
S			1.15.2.2.2.3	Fathers pass X-linked alleles to all of their daughters but to none of their sons.
S			1.15.2.1.5.5	Because there are so few Y-linked genes, very few disorders are transferred from father to son on the Y chromosome.
S			1.15.6.6.6	Fathers transmit this and other X-linked alleles to all daughters but to no sons.
S			1.15.2.1.6.2	The fact that males and females inherit a different number of X chromosomes leads to a pattern of inheritance different from that produced by genes located on autosomes.
S			1.15.2.1.5.4	The Y chromosome is passed along virtually intact from a father to all his sons.
S			1.13.1.1.1.2	The genes we inherit from our mothers and fathers are our genetic link to our parents, and they account for family resemblances such as shared eye color or freckles.
S			1.1.1.6.2.4	DNA is the substance of genes, the units of inheritance that transmit information from parents to offspring.
S			1.18.5.1.3.2	In general, an oncogene arises from a genetic change that leads to an increase either in the amount of the proto-oncogene's protein product or in the intrinsic activity of each protein molecule.
S			1.18.5.1.2.1	Cancer research led to the discovery of cancer-causing genes called oncogenes (from the Greek onco, tumor) in certain types of viruses (see Chapter 19).

Q	Did a male with an X-linked disease inherit it from his mother or his father?
A	"Mother"
S			1.15.2.2.3.5	However, even though the chance of a female inheriting a double dose of the mutant allele is much less than the probability of a male inheriting a single dose, there are females with X-linked disorders.
S			1.15.2.3.2.2	As a consequence, females consist of a mosaic of two types of cells: those with the active X derived from the father and those with the active X derived from the mother.
S			4.5495.1.1	A X-linked inheritance from male parent is a inheritance of a gene on the male parent's X chromosome.
S			1.15.2.1.5.5	Because there are so few Y-linked genes, very few disorders are transferred from father to son on the Y chromosome.
S			4.5493.1.1	A X-linked inheritance from homozygous female parent is a inheritance of characteristics that are determined by genes carried on the maternal X chromosomes of a female parent who is homozygous for the defined characteristic.
S			4.5491.1.1	A X-linked inheritance from heterozygous female parent is a inheritance of characteristics that are determined by genes carried on the maternal X chromosomes of a female parent who is heterozygous for the defined characteristic.
S			1.15.6.6.7	Any male who inherits such an allele from his mother will express the trait.
S			1.13.1.1.1.2	The genes we inherit from our mothers and fathers are our genetic link to our parents, and they account for family resemblances such as shared eye color or freckles.
S			1.15.2.2.3.3	Any male receiving the recessive allele from his mother will express the trait.
S			1.46.5.4.1.1.5	A blood sample from the mother yields fetal cells that can be identified with specific antibodies (which bind to proteins on the surface of fetal cells) and then tested for genetic disorders.

Q	What sex chromosomes can females pass on to their offspring?
A	"X chromosome"
S			1.15.2.1.3.4	We can trace the sex of each offspring to the events of conception: If a sperm cell bearing an X chromosome happens to fertilize an egg, the zygote is XX, a female; if a sperm cell containing a Y chromosome fertilizes an egg, the zygote is XY, a male (see Figure 15.6a).
S			1.13.1.1.3.3	During fertilization, male and female gametes (sperm and eggs) unite, thereby passing on genes of both parents to their offspring.
S			1.15.2.1.6.2	The fact that males and females inherit a different number of X chromosomes leads to a pattern of inheritance different from that produced by genes located on autosomes.
S			1.15.2.3.1.6	In the ovaries, Barr-body chromosomes are reactivated in the cells that give rise to eggs, so every female gamete has an active X. Figure 15.8 X inactivation and the tortoiseshell cat.
S			1.15.0.0.2.4	This chapter extends what you learned in the past two chapters: We describe the chromosomal basis for the transmission of genes from parents to offspring, along with some important exceptions to the standard mode of inheritance.
S			4.1938.1.1	Female offspring is a one who belongs to the sex that can have babies.
S			1.15.4.3.3.1.7	These altered chromosomes result from the reciprocal translocation shown here, which presumably occurred in a single white blood cell precursor undergoing mitosis and was then passed along to all descendant cells.
S			1.50.3.2.4.3.2	Because the human genes for the red and green pigments are located on the X chromosome, a single defective copy of either gene can disrupt color vision in males (see Figure 15.7 to review the genetics of sex-linked traits).
S			1.14.1.2.1.5.10	To construct a Punnett square that predicts the F2 generation offspring, we list all the possible gametes from one parent (here, the F1 female) along the left side of the square and all the possible gametes from the other parent (here, the F1 male) along the top.
S			1.21.5.4.2.1	We've already seen that unequal crossing over during meiosis can lead to duplication of a gene on one chromosome and its loss from the homologous chromosome (see Figure 21.13).

Q	How many copies of an X-linked dominant disease allele does a male need to be affected?
A	"One"
S			4.2485.1.1	A huntington's chorea is a human genetic disease caused by a dominant allele; characterized by uncontrollable body movements and degeneration of the nervous system; usually fatal 10 to 20 years after the onset of symptoms.
S			1.15.1.1.2.2.4	For a male, a single copy of the mutant allele would confer white eyes; since a male has only one X chromosome, there can be no wild-type allele (w+) present to mask the recessive allele.
S			4.4591.1.1	A sex linked hemophilia gene is a gene for a human genetic disease caused by a recessive allele located on the X-chromosome resulting in the absence of one or more blood-clotting proteins.
S			1.23.2.2.3.1.3	For example, consider phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder that results from homozygosity for a recessive allele and occurs in about one out of every 10,000 babies born in the United States.
S			4.5485.1.1	A X chromosome phenotype dominant is the phenotype of a female who has one or two dominant alleles for an X chromosome gene or of a male who has the dominant allele for an X chromosome gene.
S			1.14.4.3.1.1.6	As with other dominant traits, a child born to a parent with the Huntington's disease allele has a 50% chance of inheriting the allele and the disorder (see the Punnett square in Figure 14.17).
S			1.14.4.3.1.1.4	For example, Huntington's disease, a degenerative disease of the nervous system, is caused by a lethal dominant allele that has no obvious phenotypic effect until the individual is about 35 to 45 years old.
S			1.14.4.2.3.2.1	Although two sickle-cell alleles are necessary for an individual to manifest full-blown sickle-cell disease, the presence of one sickle-cell allele can affect the phenotype.
S			1.23.2.2.3.14.1	A locus that affects susceptibility to a degenerative brain disease has two alleles, A and a. In a population, 16 people have genotype AA, 92 have genotype Aa, and 12 have genotype aa.
S			1.20.2.4.4.9	A SNP that varies in this way is likely to be closely linked to one or more alleles of genes that contribute to the disease in question.

Q	How many copies of an X-linked recessive disease allele does a female need to be affected?
A	"Two"
S			1.23.2.2.3.1.3	For example, consider phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder that results from homozygosity for a recessive allele and occurs in about one out of every 10,000 babies born in the United States.
S			4.4591.1.1	A sex linked hemophilia gene is a gene for a human genetic disease caused by a recessive allele located on the X-chromosome resulting in the absence of one or more blood-clotting proteins.
S			1.15.1.1.2.2.4	For a male, a single copy of the mutant allele would confer white eyes; since a male has only one X chromosome, there can be no wild-type allele (w+) present to mask the recessive allele.
S			1.15.2.2.5.1	Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder defined by the absence of one or more of the proteins required for blood clotting.
S			4.2378.1.1	Hemophilia is a human genetic disease caused by a sex-linked recessive allele resulting in the absence of one or more blood-clotting proteins; characterized by excessive bleeding following injury.
S			4.5486.1.1	A X chromosome phenotype recessive is the phenotype of a female who has two recessive alleles for an X chromosome gene or of a male who has the recessive allele for an X chromosome gene.
S			1.14.4.2.3.2.1	Although two sickle-cell alleles are necessary for an individual to manifest full-blown sickle-cell disease, the presence of one sickle-cell allele can affect the phenotype.
S			1.15.2.3.2.3	After an X chromosome is inactivated in a particular cell, all mitotic descendants of that cell have the same inactive X. Thus, if a female is heterozygous for a sex-linked trait, about half her cells will express one allele, while the others will express the alternate allele.
S			1.14.4.2.1.2.4	In the case of disorders classified as recessive, heterozygotes (Aa) are typically normal in phenotype because one copy of the normal allele (A) produces a sufficient amount of the specific protein.
S			1.20.2.4.4.9	A SNP that varies in this way is likely to be closely linked to one or more alleles of genes that contribute to the disease in question.

Q	How many copies of a Y-linked disease allele does a male need to be affected?
A	"One"
S			1.14.4.2.3.2.1	Although two sickle-cell alleles are necessary for an individual to manifest full-blown sickle-cell disease, the presence of one sickle-cell allele can affect the phenotype.
S			1.23.2.2.3.14.1	A locus that affects susceptibility to a degenerative brain disease has two alleles, A and a. In a population, 16 people have genotype AA, 92 have genotype Aa, and 12 have genotype aa.

S			1.15.1.1.2.2.4	For a male, a single copy of the mutant allele would confer white eyes; since a male has only one X chromosome, there can be no wild-type allele (w+) present to mask the recessive allele.
S			1.17.5.6.5	In individuals who are homozygous for the mutant allele, the sickling of red blood cells caused by the altered hemoglobin produces the multiple symptoms associated with sickle-cell disease (see Chapter 14).
S			1.15.4.1.3.3	Fertilization involving a gamete that has no copy of a particular chromosome will lead to a missing chromosome in the zygote (so that the cell has 2n -' 1 chromosomes); the aneuploid zygote is said to be monosomic for that chromosome.
S			1.49.5.2.2.1	Bipolar disorder, or manic-depressive disorder, involves swings of mood from high to low and affects about 1% of the world's population.
S			1.20.2.1.22.1	The identification of carriers of mutant alleles associated with genetic diseases is only one of the ways Southern blotting has been used.
S			1.17.2.2.2.1.2	RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template strand, joining complementary RNA nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing RNA transcript.
S			1.23.2.2.3.1.3	For example, consider phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder that results from homozygosity for a recessive allele and occurs in about one out of every 10,000 babies born in the United States.

Q	For an X-linked recessive disease, what must the father of an affected female be?
A	"Affected"	"He must have the disease"
S			1.15.2.2.3.4	For this reason, far more males than females have X-linked recessive disorders.
S			4.4591.1.1	A sex linked hemophilia gene is a gene for a human genetic disease caused by a recessive allele located on the X-chromosome resulting in the absence of one or more blood-clotting proteins.
S			1.15.2.2.3.1	If an X-linked trait is due to a recessive allele, a female will express the phenotype only if she is homozygous for that allele.
S			1.15.2.2.3.5	However, even though the chance of a female inheriting a double dose of the mutant allele is much less than the probability of a male inheriting a single dose, there are females with X-linked disorders.
S			1.15.2.2.5.1	Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder defined by the absence of one or more of the proteins required for blood clotting.
S			4.5494.1.1	A form of X chromosome linked inheritance whereby the female parent is homozygous recessive for the inherited trait.
S			1.23.2.2.3.1.3	For example, consider phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder that results from homozygosity for a recessive allele and occurs in about one out of every 10,000 babies born in the United States.
S			1.15.2.3.2.5	In humans, mosaicism can be observed in a recessive X-linked mutation that prevents the development of sweat glands.
S			1.49.3.1.2.4	Frontal and temporal areas become active when meaning must be attached to words, such as when a person generates verbs to go with nouns or groups related words or concepts (Figure 49.16, lower right image).
S			1.15.1.1.2.2.5	On the other hand, a female could have white eyes only if both her X chromosomes carried the recessive mutant allele (w).

Q	For an X-linked recessive disease, what must the mother of an affected female be?
A	"Heterozygous or homozygous for the disease"
S			1.15.2.2.3.4	For this reason, far more males than females have X-linked recessive disorders.
S			4.4591.1.1	A sex linked hemophilia gene is a gene for a human genetic disease caused by a recessive allele located on the X-chromosome resulting in the absence of one or more blood-clotting proteins.
S			1.15.2.2.3.1	If an X-linked trait is due to a recessive allele, a female will express the phenotype only if she is homozygous for that allele.
S			4.5494.1.1	A form of X chromosome linked inheritance whereby the female parent is homozygous recessive for the inherited trait.
S			1.15.2.2.3.5	However, even though the chance of a female inheriting a double dose of the mutant allele is much less than the probability of a male inheriting a single dose, there are females with X-linked disorders.

S			4.5493.1.1	A X-linked inheritance from homozygous female parent is a inheritance of characteristics that are determined by genes carried on the maternal X chromosomes of a female parent who is homozygous for the defined characteristic.
S			4.5491.1.1	A X-linked inheritance from heterozygous female parent is a inheritance of characteristics that are determined by genes carried on the maternal X chromosomes of a female parent who is heterozygous for the defined characteristic.
S			1.23.2.2.3.1.3	For example, consider phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder that results from homozygosity for a recessive allele and occurs in about one out of every 10,000 babies born in the United States.
S			1.49.3.1.2.4	Frontal and temporal areas become active when meaning must be attached to words, such as when a person generates verbs to go with nouns or groups related words or concepts (Figure 49.16, lower right image).

Q	Can males be carriers for X-linked traits?
A	"No"
S			1.50.3.2.4.3.2	Because the human genes for the red and green pigments are located on the X chromosome, a single defective copy of either gene can disrupt color vision in males (see Figure 15.7 to review the genetics of sex-linked traits).
S			4.5490.1.1	A form of X chromosome linked inheritance whereby the male parent is dominant for the inherited trait.
S			4.5496.1.1	A form of X chromosome linked inheritance whereby the male parent is recessive for the inherited trait.
S			1.15.1.1.2.2.2	The correlation between the trait of white eye color and the male sex of the affected F2 flies suggested to Morgan that the gene involved in his white-eyed mutant was located exclusively on the X chromosome, with no corresponding allele present on the Y chromosome.
S			1.14.4.2.1.3.4	From the genotypic ratio, we also can see that out of three offspring with the normal phenotype (one AA plus two Aa), two are predicted to be heterozygous carriers, a 2/3 chance.
S			1.15.1.1.2.11.2	Since the recessive trait: white eyes: was expressed only in males in the F2 generation, Morgan deduced that this eye-color gene is located on the X chromosome and that there is no corresponding locus on the Y chromosome.
S			1.15.2.1.3.4	We can trace the sex of each offspring to the events of conception: If a sperm cell bearing an X chromosome happens to fertilize an egg, the zygote is XX, a female; if a sperm cell containing a Y chromosome fertilizes an egg, the zygote is XY, a male (see Figure 15.6a).
S			4.5486.1.1	A X chromosome phenotype recessive is the phenotype of a female who has two recessive alleles for an X chromosome gene or of a male who has the recessive allele for an X chromosome gene.
S			4.5485.1.1	A X chromosome phenotype dominant is the phenotype of a female who has one or two dominant alleles for an X chromosome gene or of a male who has the dominant allele for an X chromosome gene.
S			1.15.2.2.3.1	If an X-linked trait is due to a recessive allele, a female will express the phenotype only if she is homozygous for that allele.

Q	Why are males affected more severely for X-linked dominant diseases?
A	"No normal gene product"	"Only mutant gene product"
S			1.15.2.2.3.4	For this reason, far more males than females have X-linked recessive disorders.
S			1.15.2.2.4.1	A number of human X-linked disorders are much more serious than color blindness.
S			4.4591.1.1	A sex linked hemophilia gene is a gene for a human genetic disease caused by a recessive allele located on the X-chromosome resulting in the absence of one or more blood-clotting proteins.
S			1.15.2.2.3.5	However, even though the chance of a female inheriting a double dose of the mutant allele is much less than the probability of a male inheriting a single dose, there are females with X-linked disorders.
S			4.5490.1.1	A form of X chromosome linked inheritance whereby the male parent is dominant for the inherited trait.
S			1.15.2.2.5.1	Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder defined by the absence of one or more of the proteins required for blood clotting.
S			1.15.2.2.4.2	An example is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which affects about one out of every 3,500 males born in the United States.
S			1.54.2.4.1.2.3	Another explanation is that dominant species are most successful at avoiding predation or the impact of disease.
S			4.5488.1.1	A X dominant and Y is the genotype of a male somatic cell containing a dominant allele for a specific gene on the X chromosome.
S			1.15.2.3.1.3	As a result, the cells of females and males have the same effective dose (one copy) of most X-linked genes.

Q	What is the difference between an offspring having a phenotype that is intermediate relative to the parents and the concept of blended inheritance?
A	"Blended inheritance does not involve discrete units"
S			1.14.1.2.1.1	If the blending model of inheritance were correct, the F1 hybrids from a cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered pea plants would have pale purple flowers, a trait intermediate between those of the P generation.
S			1.17.1.3.3.6.1	In a research article about alkaptonuria published in 1902, Garrod suggested that humans inherit two "characters" (alleles) for a particular enzyme and that both parents must contribute a faulty version for the offspring to have the disorder.
S			1.14.4.3.1.1.6	As with other dominant traits, a child born to a parent with the Huntington's disease allele has a 50% chance of inheriting the allele and the disorder (see the Punnett square in Figure 14.17).
S			1.15.3.1.1.1	To see how linkage between genes affects the inheritance of two different characters, let's examine another of Morgan's Drosophila experiments.
S			1.14.3.2.2.2.7	In a large number of such matings, the majority of offspring would be expected to have intermediate phenotypes (skin color in the middle range).
S			1.23.4.1.1.1	In examining how natural selection brings about adaptive evolution, we'll begin with the concept of relative fitness and the different ways that an organism's phenotype is subject to natural selection.
S			1.15.3.2.1.2.1	Notice in this Punnett square that one-half of the offspring are expected to inherit a phenotype that matches either of the parental (P generation) phenotypes.
S			1.14.5.12.1	Analysis of family pedigrees can be used to deduce the possible genotypes of individuals and make predictions about future offspring.
S			1.13.1.2.5.2	Explain what causes the traits of parents (such as hair color) to show up in their offspring.
S			1.13.1.1.3.1	The transmission of hereditary traits has its molecular basis in the precise replication of DNA, which produces copies of genes that can be passed from parents to offspring.

Q	What is a trisomy?
A	"Three of a particular kind of chromosome"
S			1.15.4.4.1	Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)
S			4.5253.1.1	A trisomy is a having 3, instead of 2, copies of a chromsome.
S			1.15.4.3.1.1.2	The karyotype shows trisomy 21, the most common cause of Down syndrome.
S			1.15.4.1.3.7	Down syndrome is an example of trisomy in humans that will be discussed later.
S			1.15.4.3.1.2.3	Because the cells are trisomic for chromosome 21, Down syndrome is often called trisomy 21.
S			1.15.4.3.3.6.2	A father who has type AB blood and a mother who has type O blood have a child with trisomy 9 and type A blood.
S			1.15.4.3.1.3.5	Trisomies of some other chromosomes also increase in incidence with maternal age, although infants with other autosomal trisomies rarely survive for long.
S			1.15.4.3.1.3.6	Due to its low risk and its potential for providing useful information, prenatal screening for trisomies in the embryo is now offered to all pregnant women.
S			1.15.6.11.7	Such alterations cause Down syndrome (usually due to trisomy of chromosome 21), certain cancers associated with chromosomal translocations, and various other human disorders.
S			4.1546.1.1	Down syndrome, or Down's syndrome (primarily in the United Kingdom), trisomy 21, or trisomy G, is a chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 21st chromosome.

Q	Why are trisomies problematic in organisms that are normally diploid?
A	"Abnormal amounts of gene products"	"Abnormal proportions of gene products"	"Abnormal gene regulation"
S			1.14.1.2.1.3.4	Recall from Chapter 13 that each somatic cell in a diploid organism has two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent.
S			4.4754.1.1	A sporophyte is a in organisms (plants and some algae) that have alternation of generations, the multicellular diploid form that results from the union of gametes.
S			1.28.6.1.1.4.4	Cellular slime molds also differ from plasmodial slime molds in being haploid organisms (only the zygote is diploid) and in having fruiting bodies that function in asexual rather than sexual reproduction.
S			1.23.2.1.5.2	Because these are diploid organisms, there are a total of 1,000 copies of the gene for flower color in the population of 500 individuals.
S			1.33.2.1.1.4	Do not confuse this with the alternation of generations that occurs in plants and some algae: In Obelia, both the polyp and the medusa are diploid organisms.
S			1.14.5.4.4	In a diploid organism, the two alleles of a gene segregate (separate) during meiosis and gamete formation; each sperm or egg carries only one allele of each pair.
S			1.31.4.2.3.4	Note that while a zygosporangium represents the zygote (2n) stage in the life cycle, it is not a zygote in the usual sense (that is, a cell with one diploid nucleus).
S			1.15.4.2.4.1	A diploid embryo that is homozygous for a large deletion (or has a single X chromosome with a large deletion, in a male) is usually missing a number of essential genes, a condition that is ordinarily lethal.
S			1.17.6.2.5.2	This is an essential feature in multicellular organisms: You'd be in trouble if the lens cells in your eyes started expressing the genes for hair proteins, which are normally expressed only in hair follicle cells!
S			1.1.1.8.1.7	In other words, we can explain traits shared by two organisms with the idea that they have descended from a common ancestor, and we can account for differences with the idea that heritable changes have occurred along the way.

Q	What is the most common outcome for aneuploidy?
A	"Fetal death"
S			1.43.4.3.5.2	Many scientists were skeptical that cancer could result from infection by HPV, the most common sexually transmitted pathogen.
S			1.47.2.3.6.1	In humans, an error in neural tube formation results in spina bifida, the most common disabling birth defect in the United States.
S			1.20.2.4.1.2	Perhaps the most common approach is to disable the gene and then observe the consequences in the cell or organism.
S			1.15.5.3.1	In the previous section, you learned about deviations from the usual patterns of chromosomal inheritance due to abnormal events in meiosis and mitosis.
S			1.23.3.3.4.3	As a result, mating is more common between members of populations that previously had very little contact, leading to an exchange of alleles and fewer genetic differences between those populations.
S			1.18.5.4.3.2	This is the second most common type of cancer in the United States, striking over 180,000 women (and some men) annually and killing 40,000 each year.
S			1.27.2.2.2.8.3	The medical consequences are also predictable: As you've read, resistant strains of pathogens are becoming more common, making the treatment of certain bacterial infections more difficult.
S			1.15.4.3.1.2	As described earlier, nondisjunction in meiosis results in aneuploidy in gametes and any resulting zygotes.
S			1.15.4.1.3.9	If such an error takes place early in embryonic development, then the aneuploid condition is passed along by mitosis to a large number of cells and is likely to have a substantial effect on the organism.
S			1.15.4.3.1.3	Although the frequency of aneuploid zygotes may be quite high in humans, most of these chromosomal alterations are so disastrous to development that the affected embryos are spontaneously aborted long before birth.

Q	What is a common outcome for aneuploidy that does not result in fetal death?
A	"Abnormal development"
S			1.15.4.3.1.2	As described earlier, nondisjunction in meiosis results in aneuploidy in gametes and any resulting zygotes.
S			1.15.4.1.3.9	If such an error takes place early in embryonic development, then the aneuploid condition is passed along by mitosis to a large number of cells and is likely to have a substantial effect on the organism.
S			1.43.3.5.1.2	In contrast, a different type of immunity results when the IgG antibodies in the blood of a pregnant female cross the placenta to her fetus.
S			1.15.4.8.3	Large-scale chromosomal alterations in humans and other mammals often lead to spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) of a fetus, and individuals born with these types of genetic defects commonly exhibit various developmental disorders.
S			1.46.5.1.1.6.3	Alcohol that reaches the developing central nervous system of the fetus can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, a disorder that can result in mental retardation and other serious birth defects.
S			1.43.1.1.1.11	This schematic depicts events in the ingestion and destruction of a microbe by a typical phagocytic cell.
S			1.43.4.2.3.3.4	For example, Pneumocystis carinii, a common fungus that does not cause disease in healthy individuals, can result in severe pneumonia in people with AIDS.
S			1.23.2.2.2.2.1	Departure from these conditions usually results in evolutionary change, which, as we've already described, is common in natural populations.
S			1.8.5.1.3.2.1	When ATP allosterically inhibits an enzyme in an ATP-generating pathway, as we discussed earlier, the result is feedback inhibition, a common mode of metabolic control.
S			1.49.5.1.1.3	Despite the commonly held notion, schizophrenia does not necessarily result in multiple personalities.

Q	What happens to allele pairs during gamete formation according to the Law of Segregation?
A	"They separate"

S			1.14.5.4.4	In a diploid organism, the two alleles of a gene segregate (separate) during meiosis and gamete formation; each sperm or egg carries only one allele of each pair.
S			1.14.3.4.3.2	Mendel's two laws, segregation and independent assortment, explain heritable variations in terms of alternative forms of genes (hereditary "particles," now known as the alleles of genes) that are passed along, generation after generation, according to simple rules of probability.
S			1.14.5.4.9	The law of independent assortment states that the pair of alleles for a given gene segregates into gametes independently of the pair of alleles for any other gene.
S			1.15.1.5.1	Figure 15.2 shows that the behavior of homologous chromosomes during meiosis can account for the segregation of the alleles at each genetic locus to different gametes.
S			4.2615.1.1	An independently inherited is the Law of Independent Assortment, also known as "Inheritance Law" states that alleles of different genes assort independently of one another during gamete formation.

Q	What happens to chromosomes during gamete formation according to the Law of Independent Assortment?
A	"Random assortment"
S			4.2841.1.1	A law of independent assortment is a mendel's second law, stating that each allele pair segregates independently during gamete formation; applies when genes for two characteristics are located on different pairs of homologous chromosomes.
S			1.14.1.3.15.4	The results of Mendel's dihybrid experiments are the basis for what we now call the law of independent assortment, which states that each pair of alleles segregates independently of each other pair of alleles during gamete formation.
S			1.14.2.2.1.2	Recall that each allelic pair segregates independently during gamete formation (the law of independent assortment).
S			4.2615.1.1	An independently inherited is the Law of Independent Assortment, also known as "Inheritance Law" states that alleles of different genes assort independently of one another during gamete formation.
S			1.13.4.1.2.2.1	As a consequence of the independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis, each of us produces a collection of gametes differing greatly in their combinations of the chromosomes we inherited from our two parents.
S			1.14.3.4.3.2	Mendel's two laws, segregation and independent assortment, explain heritable variations in terms of alternative forms of genes (hereditary "particles," now known as the alleles of genes) that are passed along, generation after generation, according to simple rules of probability.
S			1.15.5.1.2.4	In each generation, the old imprints are "erased" in gamete-producing cells, and the chromosomes of the developing gametes are newly imprinted according to the sex of the individual forming the gametes.
S			1.13.4.1.3.1.2	In humans, each male and female gamete represents one of about 8.4 million (223) possible chromosome combinations due to independent assortment.
S			4.973.1.1	According to the chromosome theory of inheritance, Mendelian genes have specific loci on chromosomes, and it is the chromosomes that undergo segregation and independent assortment.
S			1.15.1.4.4	According to this theory, Mendelian genes have specific loci (positions) along chromosomes, and it is the chromosomes that undergo segregation and independent assortment.

Q	What does the Law of Segregation concern?
A	"Allele pairs"
S			1.14.1.2.1.1.2	We describe four related concepts making up this model, the fourth of which is the law of segregation.
S			4.3420.1.1	A non mendelian genetics is a general term that refers to any pattern of inheritance in which traits do not segregate in accordance with Mendel's laws.
S			1.14.1.3.15.3	As far as a single character is concerned, the alleles segregate as if this were a monohybrid cross.
S			4.2841.1.1	A law of independent assortment is a mendel's second law, stating that each allele pair segregates independently during gamete formation; applies when genes for two characteristics are located on different pairs of homologous chromosomes.
S			1.15.6.4.1	The chromosome theory of inheritance states that genes are located on chromosomes and that the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis accounts for Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment.
S			1.15.0.0.1.3	Even after chromosomes were first observed, many biologists remained skeptical about Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment until there was sufficient evidence that these principles of heredity had a physical basis in chromosomal behavior.
S			1.14.5.10.5	Even in more complex inheritance patterns, Mendel's fundamental laws of segregation and independent assortment still apply.
S			1.14.2.3.1	Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment reflect the same rules of probability that apply to tossing coins, rolling dice, and drawing cards from a deck.
S			1.14.1.1.15.7	Mendel's quantitative analysis of the F2 plants from thousands of genetic crosses like these allowed him to deduce two fundamental principles of heredity, which have come to be called the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment.

Q	What does the Law of Independent Assortment concern?
A	"All chromosomes"
S			1.14.3.2.1.2.2	Although the two genes affect the same phenotypic character (coat color), they follow the law of independent assortment.
S			4.2841.1.1	A law of independent assortment is a mendel's second law, stating that each allele pair segregates independently during gamete formation; applies when genes for two characteristics are located on different pairs of homologous chromosomes.

S			1.14.5.10.5	Even in more complex inheritance patterns, Mendel's fundamental laws of segregation and independent assortment still apply.
S			1.14.2.3.1	Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment reflect the same rules of probability that apply to tossing coins, rolling dice, and drawing cards from a deck.
S			1.14.1.1.15.7	Mendel's quantitative analysis of the F2 plants from thousands of genetic crosses like these allowed him to deduce two fundamental principles of heredity, which have come to be called the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment.
S			1.14.3.4.3.2	Mendel's two laws, segregation and independent assortment, explain heritable variations in terms of alternative forms of genes (hereditary "particles," now known as the alleles of genes) that are passed along, generation after generation, according to simple rules of probability.
S			1.15.3.7.5	When geneticists follow linked genes in breeding experiments, the results deviate from those expected from Mendel's law of independent assortment.
S			1.14.2.2.1.2	Recall that each allelic pair segregates independently during gamete formation (the law of independent assortment).

Q	What proportion of F1 offspring will have the recessive phenotype for a dominant/recessive type monohybrid cross?
A	"None"
S			1.14.1.2.2.1.4	If we cross dominant homozygotes with recessive homozygotes, every offspring will have two different alleles: Pp in the case of the F1 hybrids of our flower-color experiment (see Figure 14.5).
S			1.14.1.3.1.2	All the F1 progeny produced in his crosses of true-breeding parents were monohybrids, meaning that they were heterozygous for the one particular character being followed in the cross.
S			1.14.4.1.4.4	This is equivalent to a Mendelian F1 monohybrid cross (Ww * Ww), and thus the probability that a child will inherit a dominant allele and have a widow's peak is 3/4 (1/4 WW + 1/2 Ww).
S			1.15.1.1.2.11.1	All F1 offspring had red eyes, so the mutant white-eye trait (w) must be recessive to the wild-type red-eye trait (w+).
S			1.14.5.14.26	For example, if 1/2 of the offspring have the recessive phenotype and 1/2 the dominant, you know that the cross was between a heterozygote and a homozygous recessive.
S			1.14.4.5.4.9.1	In Table 14.1, note the phenotypic ratio of the dominant to recessive trait in the F2 generation for the monohybrid cross involving flower color.
S			1.14.4.2.1.3.2	A mating between two carriers corresponds to a Mendelian F1 monohybrid cross, so the predicted genotypic ratio for the offspring is 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa.
S			1.15.6.9.1	Among offspring from an F1 testcross, parental types have the same combination of traits as those in the P generation parents.
S			1.14.3.1.1.2.1	For some genes, however, neither allele is completely dominant, and the F1 hybrids have a phenotype somewhere between those of the two parental varieties.
S			1.15.3.2.1.2.6	The predicted phenotypic ratios among the offspring are similar to what Mendel actually found in YyRr * yyrr crosses (a type of testcross because it reveals the genotype of the gametes made by the dihybrid YyRr plant).

Q	What proportion of F2 offspring will have the recessive phenotype for a dominant/recessive type monohybrid cross?
A	"0.25"
S			1.14.4.5.4.9.1	In Table 14.1, note the phenotypic ratio of the dominant to recessive trait in the F2 generation for the monohybrid cross involving flower color.
S			1.14.5.14.26	For example, if 1/2 of the offspring have the recessive phenotype and 1/2 the dominant, you know that the cross was between a heterozygote and a homozygous recessive.
S			1.14.1.2.2.1.4	If we cross dominant homozygotes with recessive homozygotes, every offspring will have two different alleles: Pp in the case of the F1 hybrids of our flower-color experiment (see Figure 14.5).
S			1.14.1.3.1.2	All the F1 progeny produced in his crosses of true-breeding parents were monohybrids, meaning that they were heterozygous for the one particular character being followed in the cross.
S			1.14.1.2.1.7.3	One-half of the F2 offspring have inherited one purple-flower allele and one white-flower allele; these plants will also have purple flowers, the dominant trait.
S			1.14.4.1.4.4	This is equivalent to a Mendelian F1 monohybrid cross (Ww * Ww), and thus the probability that a child will inherit a dominant allele and have a widow's peak is 3/4 (1/4 WW + 1/2 Ww).
S			1.15.3.2.1.2.6	The predicted phenotypic ratios among the offspring are similar to what Mendel actually found in YyRr * yyrr crosses (a type of testcross because it reveals the genotype of the gametes made by the dihybrid YyRr plant).
S			1.15.1.1.2.11.1	All F1 offspring had red eyes, so the mutant white-eye trait (w) must be recessive to the wild-type red-eye trait (w+).
S			4.736.1.2	The heterozygote is phenotypically dominant for the character determined by the gene but can pass on the recessive allele to offspring.
S			1.14.2.1.2.5	For a particular F2 plant to have wrinkled seeds, the recessive trait, both the egg and the sperm that come together must carry the r allele.

Q	What proportion of F1 offspring will have the dominant phenotype for a dominant/recessive type monohybrid cross?
A	"All"
S			1.14.1.2.2.1.4	If we cross dominant homozygotes with recessive homozygotes, every offspring will have two different alleles: Pp in the case of the F1 hybrids of our flower-color experiment (see Figure 14.5).
S			1.14.1.3.1.2	All the F1 progeny produced in his crosses of true-breeding parents were monohybrids, meaning that they were heterozygous for the one particular character being followed in the cross.

S			1.15.1.1.2.11.1	All F1 offspring had red eyes, so the mutant white-eye trait (w) must be recessive to the wild-type red-eye trait (w+).
S			1.14.5.14.26	For example, if 1/2 of the offspring have the recessive phenotype and 1/2 the dominant, you know that the cross was between a heterozygote and a homozygous recessive.
S			1.14.4.5.4.9.1	In Table 14.1, note the phenotypic ratio of the dominant to recessive trait in the F2 generation for the monohybrid cross involving flower color.
S			1.14.4.2.1.3.2	A mating between two carriers corresponds to a Mendelian F1 monohybrid cross, so the predicted genotypic ratio for the offspring is 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa.
S			1.15.6.9.1	Among offspring from an F1 testcross, parental types have the same combination of traits as those in the P generation parents.
S			1.14.3.1.1.2.1	For some genes, however, neither allele is completely dominant, and the F1 hybrids have a phenotype somewhere between those of the two parental varieties.
S			1.15.3.2.1.2.6	The predicted phenotypic ratios among the offspring are similar to what Mendel actually found in YyRr * yyrr crosses (a type of testcross because it reveals the genotype of the gametes made by the dihybrid YyRr plant).

Q	An F1 offspring from a monohybrid cross for a trait that exhibits incomplete dominance will have what kind of phenotype relative to the parents?
A	"Intermediate"
S			1.14.1.3.1.2	All the F1 progeny produced in his crosses of true-breeding parents were monohybrids, meaning that they were heterozygous for the one particular character being followed in the cross.
S			1.15.6.9.1	Among offspring from an F1 testcross, parental types have the same combination of traits as those in the P generation parents.
S			1.15.3.2.1.1.1	Mendel learned from crosses in which he followed two characters that some offspring have combinations of traits that do not match those of either parent.
S			1.14.3.1.1.2.1	For some genes, however, neither allele is completely dominant, and the F1 hybrids have a phenotype somewhere between those of the two parental varieties.
S			1.13.1.2.5.2	Explain what causes the traits of parents (such as hair color) to show up in their offspring.
S			1.14.3.1.1.3.1	At first glance, incomplete dominance of either allele seems to provide evidence for the blending hypothesis of inheritance, which would predict that the red or white trait could never be retrieved from the pink hybrids.
S			1.15.3.2.2.1.2	Recall that most of the offspring from the testcross for body color and wing size had parental phenotypes.
S			1.14.5.52.2	In a short essay (100-150 words), explain how the passage of genes from parents to offspring, in the form of particular alleles, ensures perpetuation of parental traits in offspring and, at the same time, genetic variation among offspring.
S			1.13.1.1.3.1	The transmission of hereditary traits has its molecular basis in the precise replication of DNA, which produces copies of genes that can be passed from parents to offspring.
S			1.14.3.1.1.1.2	In Mendel's classic pea crosses, the F1 offspring always looked like one of the two parental varieties because one allele in a pair showed complete dominance over the other.

Q	What proportion of F2 offspring from a monohybrid cross for a trait that exhibits incomplete dominance will have the intermediate phenotype?
A	"1/2"
S			1.14.1.2.2.1.10	Grouping F2 offspring from a cross for flower color according to phenotype results in the typical 3:1 phenotypic ratio.
S			1.14.3.2.2.2.7	In a large number of such matings, the majority of offspring would be expected to have intermediate phenotypes (skin color in the middle range).
S			1.14.3.1.1.4.6	Note that the MN phenotype is not intermediate between the M and N phenotypes, which distinguishes codominance from incomplete dominance.
S			1.14.4.5.4.9.1	In Table 14.1, note the phenotypic ratio of the dominant to recessive trait in the F2 generation for the monohybrid cross involving flower color.
S			1.14.3.1.1.3.1	At first glance, incomplete dominance of either allele seems to provide evidence for the blending hypothesis of inheritance, which would predict that the red or white trait could never be retrieved from the pink hybrids.
S			1.23.2.1.4.3	These alleles show incomplete dominance (see  Figure 14.10); thus, each genotype has a distinct phenotype.
S			1.15.3.2.1.1.1	Mendel learned from crosses in which he followed two characters that some offspring have combinations of traits that do not match those of either parent.
S			1.14.1.2.1.1	If the blending model of inheritance were correct, the F1 hybrids from a cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered pea plants would have pale purple flowers, a trait intermediate between those of the P generation.
S			4.2604.1.3	Incomplete dominance occurs when the phenotype of the heterozygous genotype is an intermediate of the phenotypes of the homozygous genotypes.
S			1.14.1.2.1.7.3	One-half of the F2 offspring have inherited one purple-flower allele and one white-flower allele; these plants will also have purple flowers, the dominant trait.

Q	Will two alleles that are on the same chromosome assort together or independently?
A	"Together"
S			1.15.3.3.13.5	Despite being on the same chromosome and thus being physically connected, the genes are genetically unlinked; alleles of such genes assort independently, as if they were on different chromosomes.
S			1.14.4.1.4.9	Assuming that the genes for these two characters are on different chromosomes, the two pairs of alleles will assort independently in this dihybrid cross (WwFf * WwFf).
S			1.15.1.5.2	The figure also shows that the behavior of nonhomologous chromosomes can account for the independent assortment of the alleles for two or more genes located on different chromosomes.
S			4.2841.1.1	A law of independent assortment is a mendel's second law, stating that each allele pair segregates independently during gamete formation; applies when genes for two characteristics are located on different pairs of homologous chromosomes.
S			1.14.3.4.3.2	Mendel's two laws, segregation and independent assortment, explain heritable variations in terms of alternative forms of genes (hereditary "particles," now known as the alleles of genes) that are passed along, generation after generation, according to simple rules of probability.
S			1.14.2.4.6	And like two separate coin tosses, the alleles of one gene segregate into gametes independently of another gene's alleles (the law of independent assortment).
S			1.15.3.2.1.3.2	The physical basis of recombination between unlinked genes is the random orientation of homologous chromosomes at metaphase I of meiosis, which leads to the independent assortment of the two unlinked genes (see Figure 13.10 and the question in the Figure 15.2 legend).
S			1.15.3.7.4	(Note the distinction between the terms sex-linked gene, referring to a single gene on a sex chromosome, and linked genes, referring to two or more genes on the same chromosome that tend to be inherited together. )
S			1.14.1.3.16.1	This law applies only to genes (allele pairs) located on different chromosomes: that is, on chromosomes that are not homologous: or very far apart on the same chromosome.
S			1.15.1.4.7	The arrangement of chromosomes at metaphase I of meiosis and their movement during anaphase I account for the segregation and independent assortment of the alleles for seed color and shape.

Q	What is the probability that two heterozygotes for sickle cell anemia will have a child homozygous for sickle cell anemia?
A	"0.25"
S			1.14.4.2.3.2.4	At the molecular level, the two alleles are codominant; both normal and abnormal (sickle-cell) hemoglobins are made in heterozygotes.
S			1.23.4.4.2.4.4	In such regions, selection favors heterozygotes over homozygous dominant individuals, who are more vulnerable to the effects of malaria, and also over homozygous recessive individuals, who develop sickle-cell disease.
S			1.14.5.14.26	For example, if 1/2 of the offspring have the recessive phenotype and 1/2 the dominant, you know that the cross was between a heterozygote and a homozygous recessive.
S			1.20.2.1.13.8	Figure 20.11 outlines the entire procedure and demonstrates how it can differentiate a heterozygote (in this case, for the sickle-cell allele) from an individual homozygous for the normal allele.
S			1.14.4.2.3.3.5	Thus, in tropical Africa, where infection with the malaria parasite is common, the sickle-cell allele confers an advantage to heterozygotes even though it is harmful in the homozygous state.
S			1.14.5.35.4	Based on this incomplete information, calculate the probability that if this couple has a child, the child will have sickle-cell disease.
S			1.14.2.1.1.7	We can determine the probability for any genotype among the offspring of two heterozygotes by multiplying together the individual probabilities of an egg and sperm having a particular allele (R or r in this example).
S			1.20.2.1.19.1	In this example, we compare genomic DNA samples from three individuals: a homozygote for the normal beta-globin allele (I), a homozygote for the mutant sickle-cell allele (II), and a heterozygote (III).
S			1.14.4.2.3.2.3	Heterozygotes (carriers), said to have sickle-cell trait, are usually healthy, but they may suffer some sickle-cell symptoms during prolonged periods of reduced blood oxygen.
S			1.14.4.2.3.3.1	About one out of ten African-Americans have sickle-cell trait, an unusually high frequency of heterozygotes for an allele with severe detrimental effects in homozygotes.

Q	What proportion of F2 offspring will have the recessive phenotype for a dominant/recessive type dihybrid cross?
A	"1/16"
S			1.15.3.2.1.2.6	The predicted phenotypic ratios among the offspring are similar to what Mendel actually found in YyRr * yyrr crosses (a type of testcross because it reveals the genotype of the gametes made by the dihybrid YyRr plant).
S			1.14.5.14.26	For example, if 1/2 of the offspring have the recessive phenotype and 1/2 the dominant, you know that the cross was between a heterozygote and a homozygous recessive.
S			1.14.1.2.2.1.4	If we cross dominant homozygotes with recessive homozygotes, every offspring will have two different alleles: Pp in the case of the F1 hybrids of our flower-color experiment (see Figure 14.5).
S			1.15.1.5.3	By carefully studying this figure, which traces the same dihybrid pea cross you learned about in Figure 14.8, you can see how the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis in the F1 generation and subsequent random fertilization give rise to the F2 phenotypic ratio observed by Mendel.
S			4.2615.1.2	While Mendel's experiments with mixing one trait always resulted in a 3:1 ratio  between dominant and recessive phenotypes, his experiments with mixing two traits (dihybrid cross) showed 9:3:3:1 ratios.
S			1.14.5.4.10	In a cross between dihybrids (individuals heterozygous for two genes), the offspring have four phenotypes in a 9:3:3:1 ratio.
S			1.14.4.5.4.9.1	In Table 14.1, note the phenotypic ratio of the dominant to recessive trait in the F2 generation for the monohybrid cross involving flower color.
S			1.14.1.2.1.7.3	One-half of the F2 offspring have inherited one purple-flower allele and one white-flower allele; these plants will also have purple flowers, the dominant trait.
S			1.15.1.1.2.11.1	All F1 offspring had red eyes, so the mutant white-eye trait (w) must be recessive to the wild-type red-eye trait (w+).
S			4.736.1.2	The heterozygote is phenotypically dominant for the character determined by the gene but can pass on the recessive allele to offspring.

Q	What proportion of F2 offspring will be homozygous for both of the dominant traits?
A	"1/16"
S			1.14.1.2.1.7.3	One-half of the F2 offspring have inherited one purple-flower allele and one white-flower allele; these plants will also have purple flowers, the dominant trait.
S			1.14.5.14.26	For example, if 1/2 of the offspring have the recessive phenotype and 1/2 the dominant, you know that the cross was between a heterozygote and a homozygous recessive.
S			1.14.2.1.3.3	That is, F1 gametes can combine to produce Rr offspring in two mutually exclusive ways: For any particular heterozygous F2 plant, the dominant allele can come from the egg or the sperm, but not from both.
S			1.14.4.2.1.5.4	Because people with recent common ancestors are more likely to carry the same recessive alleles than are unrelated people, it is more likely that a mating of close relatives will produce offspring homozygous for recessive traits: including harmful ones.
S			1.15.3.2.2.3.3	Fertilization of these various classes of eggs by homozygous recessive sperm (b vg) produced an offspring population in which 17% exhibited a nonparental, recombinant phenotype, reflecting combinations of alleles not seen before in either P generation parent.
S			1.14.1.2.2.1.10	Grouping F2 offspring from a cross for flower color according to phenotype results in the typical 3:1 phenotypic ratio.
S			1.56.2.1.1.2.4	Inbreeding often reduces fitness because offspring are more likely to be homozygous for harmful recessive traits.
S			1.15.6.31.4	The resulting F1 progeny are crossed with homozygous white-oval plants, and 1,000 F2 progeny are obtained.
S			4.2440.1.1	A homozygous dominant is an individual who carries two copies of the allele that code for the dominant trait.
S			1.14.1.2.3.1.5	If all the offspring of the cross have purple flowers, then the purple-flowered mystery plant must be homozygous for the dominant allele, because a PP * pp cross produces all Pp offspring.

Q	If an organism is expressing a dominant phenotype for a dominant/recessive type trait, can it be heterozygous or homozygous?
A	"Both"	"Heterozygous"	"Homozygous"
S			1.14.1.2.3.5.1	An organism that exhibits a dominant trait, such as purple flowers in pea plants, can be either homozygous for the dominant allele or heterozygous.
S			1.14.5.28.3	homozygous for the three dominant traits homozygous for the three recessive traits heterozygous for all three characters homozygous for axial and tall, heterozygous for seed shape
S			1.14.2.2.4.3	Let's cross a trihybrid with purple flowers and yellow, round seeds (heterozygous for all three genes) with a plant with purple flowers and green, wrinkled seeds (heterozygous for flower color but homozygous recessive for the other two characters).
S			1.14.5.14.5	If the phenotype is that of the dominant trait (for example, purple flowers), then the genotype is either homozygous dominant or heterozygous (PP or Pp, in this example).
S			4.736.1.2	The heterozygote is phenotypically dominant for the character determined by the gene but can pass on the recessive allele to offspring.
S			1.14.4.1.2.2	This trait, called a widow's peak, is due to a dominant allele, W. Because the widow's-peak allele is dominant, all individuals who lack a widow's peak must be homozygous recessive (ww).
S			1.14.5.14.26	For example, if 1/2 of the offspring have the recessive phenotype and 1/2 the dominant, you know that the cross was between a heterozygote and a homozygous recessive.
S			1.14.4.3.3.3	A lethal recessive allele can be passed from one generation to the next by heterozygous carriers because the carriers themselves have normal phenotypes.
S			1.15.2.2.3.1	If an X-linked trait is due to a recessive allele, a female will express the phenotype only if she is homozygous for that allele.
S			1.14.1.2.3.7.1	In a testcross, the individual with the unknown genotype is crossed with a homozygous individual expressing the recessive trait (white flowers in this example), and Punnett squares are used to predict the possible outcomes.

Q	What does the genotype of an organism refer to?
A	"Its genetic makeup"	"Its genetics"
S			1.14.3.4.2.2	Similarly, the term genotype can refer to an organism's entire genetic makeup, not just its alleles for a single genetic locus.
S			1.23.4.1.1.2.1	Although we often refer to the relative fitness of a genotype, remember that the entity that is subjected to natural selection is the whole organism, not the underlying genotype.
S			1.14.1.2.3.5.2	To determine the organism's genotype, geneticists can perform a testcross.
S			4.5041.1.1	A testcross is a breeding an organism of unknown genotype with a homozygous recessive individual to determine the unknown genotype.
S			1.15.3.2.3.2.2	If the traits conferred by particular combinations of alleles are better suited for a given environment, organisms possessing those genotypes will be expected to thrive and leave more offspring, ensuring the continuation of their genetic complement.
S			4.3761.1.4	The ratio indicates the number of heterozygotes and homozygotes with reference to the genotypic ratio and to the number of phenotypes expressed as phenotypic ratio.
S			4.3761.1.6	The result obtained for a cross between a single character is called monohybrid cross and the ratio is referred to as monohybrid ratio which is 1:2:1 for genotypic ratio and 3:1 for phenotypic ratio.
S			4.536.1.1	A biological process is a process related to living organisms.
S			1.37.4.4.3	A soil's composition refers to its inorganic and organic components.
S			1.28.4.5.1	Many species in Rhizaria are among the organisms referred to as amoebas.

Q	What is adaptive evolution driven by?
A	"Natural selection"
S			1.23.5.69.1	23.4 Natural selection is the only mechanism that consistently causes adaptive evolution
S			1.23.3.3.12.1	23.4 Natural selection is the only mechanism that consistently causes adaptive evolution
S			1.23.5.1	23.4 Natural selection is the only mechanism that consistently causes adaptive evolution
S			1.23.4.2.3.4	As a result, what constitutes a "good match" between an organism and its environment can be a moving target, making adaptive evolution a continuous, dynamic process.
S			1.23.3.1.3.3	By consistently favoring some alleles over others, natural selection can cause adaptive evolution (evolution that results in a better match between organisms and their environment).
S			1.23.5.10.1	One organism has greater relative fitness than a second organism if it leaves more fertile descendants than the second organism.
S			1.23.4.4.1	The Key Role of Natural Selection in Adaptive Evolution
S			1.23.4.2.4.5	Natural selection is the only evolutionary mechanism that consistently leads to adaptive evolution.
S			1.23.4.5.5.2	Explain why natural selection is the only evolutionary mechanism that consistently leads to adaptive evolution.
S			1.23.4.10.3	Instead, natural selection consistently increases the frequencies of alleles that provide reproductive advantage and thus leads to adaptive evolution.

Q	What does natural selection act on?
A	"Genetic variation"
S			1.21.5.3.1.3.4	Presumably, natural selection acted on these altered genes, maintaining them in the population.
S			1.1.2.3.7.2	Explain why "editing" is an appropriate metaphor for how natural selection acts on a population's heritable variation.
S			1.22.2.2.2.3.4	Natural selection may act on these variations only if they are heritable and  they affect the beetles' ability to survive and reproduce.
S			1.53.0.0.4.2	Populations evolve as natural selection acts on heritable variations among individuals, changing the frequencies of alleles and traits over time.
S			1.23.0.0.1.2	It is true that natural selection acts on individuals: Each organism's traits affect its survival and reproductive success compared with other individuals.
S			1.51.1.4.2.11.2	Based on what you know about natural selection, suggest why some species might respond like minnows, some might increase activity, and some might show no change.
S			1.23.5.10.2	The modes of natural selection differ in how selection acts on phenotype (the white arrows in the summary diagram below represent selective pressure on a population).
S			1.8.6.24.1	Natural selection, acting on organisms with mutant genes encoding altered enzymes, is a major evolutionary force responsible for the diverse array of enzymes found in organisms.
S			1.25.1.4.3.3	Although the first such protocells must have carried only limited amounts of genetic information, specifying only a few properties, their inherited characteristics could have been acted on by natural selection.
S			1.23.5.11.5	There are constraints to evolution: Natural selection can act only on available variation; structures result from modified ancestral anatomy; adaptations are often compromises; and chance, natural selection, and the environment interact.

Q	Do individuals or populations evolve?
A	"Populations"
S			1.53.0.0.4.2	Populations evolve as natural selection acts on heritable variations among individuals, changing the frequencies of alleles and traits over time.
S			1.23.0.0.2.10	Rather, the proportion of large beaks in the population increased from generation to generation: The population evolved, not its individual members.
S			1.23.5.4.1	Genetic variation refers to genetic differences among individuals within a population.
S			1.22.2.2.3.3.2	Thus, even if a trait is heritable, if all the individuals in a population are genetically identical for that trait, evolution by natural selection cannot occur.
S			1.23.2.6.1	Although the individuals in a population must differ genetically for evolution to occur, the presence of genetic variation does not guarantee that a population will evolve.
S			1.49.5.7.7	First cousins, uncles, and aunts of a person with schizophrenia have twice the risk of unrelated members of the population of developing the disease.
S			1.14.4.2.1.6.4	These rules may have evolved out of empirical observation that in most populations, stillbirths and birth defects are more common when parents are closely related.
S			1.51.3.1.1.1.5	Figure 51.13 Evolution of foraging behavior by laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster.
S			1.23.0.0.2.8	However, the individual finches did not evolve.
S			1.23.0.0.1.1	One common misconception about evolution is that individual organisms evolve.

Q	What is a mechanism by which genetic variation can be decreased?
A	"Founder effect"	"Genetic drift"	"Bottleneck effect"	"Inbreeding"
S			1.24.2.3.6.2	Describe two mechanisms that can decrease gene flow in sympatric populations, thereby making sympatric speciation more likely to occur.
S			1.21.5.3.1.2	One mechanism by which a gene (or other DNA segment) can be duplicated is recombination during meiosis between copies of a transposable element flanking the gene.
S			1.39.1.3.2.2.1	The mechanism by which a signal promotes developmental changes may depend on transcription factors that are activators (which increase transcription of specific genes) or repressors (which decrease transcription) or both.
S			1.23.4.2.4.3	Genetic drift can cause the frequency of a slightly beneficial allele to increase, but it also can cause the frequency of such an allele to decrease.
S			1.13.4.2.4.8	Taken as a whole, these studies support the idea that genetic variation is evolutionarily advantageous and that a different mechanism to generate genetic variation has evolved in bdelloid rotifers.
S			1.24.0.0.4.3	We examined microevolutionary mechanisms (mutation, natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow) in Chapter 23, and we'll turn to macroevolution in Chapter 25.
S			4.2190.1.2	Three mechanisms that contribute to the genetic variation arising from sexual reproduction are independent assortment of chromosomes, crossing over and random fertilization.
S			1.13.4.1.1.2	Let's examine three mechanisms that contribute to the genetic variation arising from sexual reproduction: independent assortment of chromosomes, crossing over, and random fertilization.
S			1.23.1.2.4.2.5	The combined effects of these three mechanisms ensure that sexual reproduction rearranges existing alleles into fresh combinations each generation, providing much of the genetic variation that makes evolution possible.
S			1.23.0.0.3.3	In fact, there are three main mechanisms that can cause allele frequency change: natural selection, genetic drift (chance events that alter allele frequencies), and gene flow (the transfer of alleles between populations).

Q	What is a gene said to be when there is only one allele present in the population?
A	"Fixed"
S			1.23.2.1.3.2	If only one allele exists for a particular locus in a population, that allele is said to be fixed in the gene pool, and all individuals are homozygous for that allele.
S			1.23.2.1.6.3	And because there are only two alleles for this gene, the frequency of the CW allele, represented by q, must be 200/1,000 = 0.2 = 20%.
S			1.23.4.5.1.22	Thus, not all alleles present in the founding population's gene pool are better suited to the new environment than the alleles that are "left behind.
S			1.15.1.1.2.2.4	For a male, a single copy of the mutant allele would confer white eyes; since a male has only one X chromosome, there can be no wild-type allele (w+) present to mask the recessive allele.
S			1.23.3.2.1.5	Chance events can also cause allele frequencies to fluctuate unpredictably from one generation to the next, especially in small populations: a process called genetic drift.
S			1.23.5.6.1	A population, a localized group of organisms belonging to one species, is united by its gene pool, the aggregate of all the alleles in the population.
S			1.23.2.2.1.12.7	And the repeated shuffling of a population's gene pool over the generations cannot, in itself, change the frequency of one allele relative to another.
S			1.15.1.1.2.2.2	The correlation between the trait of white eye color and the male sex of the affected F2 flies suggested to Morgan that the gene involved in his white-eyed mutant was located exclusively on the X chromosome, with no corresponding allele present on the Y chromosome.
S			1.14.3.10.2	For the work that led to his two laws of inheritance, Mendel chose pea plant characters that turn out to have a relatively simple genetic basis: Each character is determined by one gene, for which there are only two alleles, one completely dominant and the other completely recessive.
S			1.43.2.3.1.5.3	In any given cell, however, only one allele of a light-chain gene and one allele of a heavy-chain gene are rearranged.

Q	What does a small population size increase the likelihood of?
A	"Genetic drift"
S			1.53.3.2.5.2	The model is also important in conservation biology for predicting how rapidly a particular population might increase in numbers after it has been reduced to a small size and for estimating sustainable harvest rates for wildlife populations.
S			1.53.3.1.4.6	At a population size of 750, the per capita rate of increase remains relatively high (one-half the maximum rate), but there are more reproducing individuals (N) in the population than at lower population sizes.
S			1.53.3.2.7.2	Explain why a population that fits the logistic growth model increases more rapidly at intermediate size than at relatively small and large sizes.
S			1.53.3.2.4.2	However, some populations show an Allee effect (named after W. C. Allee, of the University of Chicago, who first described it), in which individuals may have a more difficult time surviving or reproducing if the population size is too small.
S			1.56.2.1.5.6.2	Migration between isolated populations of grizzlies could increase both effective and total population sizes.
S			1.56.2.1.1.3.8	Thus, low genetic diversity does not always impede population growth.
S			1.53.4.2.11.4	Small size may also increase the chance of seedling establishment by enabling the seeds to be carried longer distances to a broader range of habitats (Figure 53.14a).
S			1.56.1.3.3.12.6	With increased harvesting spurred by such high prices, it took just ten years to reduce the western North Atlantic bluefin population to less than 20% of its 1980 size.
S			1.53.7.9.2	A more realistic population model limits growth by incorporating carrying capacity (K), the maximum population size the environment can support.
S			1.23.3.2.4.1.3	Although chance events occur in populations of all sizes, they tend to alter allele frequencies substantially only in small populations.

Q	The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model states that in the absence of external forces, what will remain constant?
A	"Genotype frequencies"
S			1.23.2.2.1.12.4	Finally, as suggested by Figure 23.8, if a population such as our wildflowers is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and its members continue to mate randomly generation after generation, allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant.
S			1.23.5.6.2	The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that the allele and genotype frequencies of a population will remain constant if the population is large, mating is random, mutation is negligible, there is no gene flow, and there is no natural selection.
S			1.23.2.2.1.1.2	This principle states that the frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a population will remain constant from generation to generation, provided that only Mendelian segregation and recombination of alleles are at work.
S			1.40.2.2.1.1	The steady body temperature of a river otter and the stable concentration of solutes in a freshwater bass are examples of homeostasis, which means "steady state," referring to the maintenance of internal balance.
S			1.23.2.2.1.6.2	Thus, the equation for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium states that at a locus with two alleles, the three genotypes will appear in the following proportions:
S			4.2350.1.1	Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is the condition describing a nonevolving population (one that is in genetic equilibrium).
S			1.8.2.3.2.3.2	The constant flow of materials in and out of the cell keeps the metabolic pathways from ever reaching equilibrium, and the cell continues to do work throughout its life.
S			1.23.2.2.3.1.1	The Hardy-Weinberg equation is often used as an initial test of whether evolution is occurring in a population (you'll encounter an example in Concept Check 23.2, question 3).
S			1.40.3.3.5.1.4	For example, shivering helps chickadees (genus Poecile), birds with a body mass of only 20 g, remain active and hold their body temperature nearly constant at 40 degree C (104 degree F) in environmental temperatures as low as -'40 degree C (-'40 degree F), as long as they have adequate food.
S			1.8.2.3.2.3.6	Some of the reversible reactions of respiration are constantly "pulled" in one direction: that is, they are kept out of equilibrium.

Q	Individuals are more likely to be homozygous for deleterious recessive alleles in what kind of population?
A	"Inbred"
S			1.14.4.2.1.5.4	Because people with recent common ancestors are more likely to carry the same recessive alleles than are unrelated people, it is more likely that a mating of close relatives will produce offspring homozygous for recessive traits: including harmful ones.
S			1.23.2.1.3.3	But if there are two or more alleles for a particular locus in a population, individuals may be either homozygous or heterozygous.
S			1.23.4.4.2.4.4	In such regions, selection favors heterozygotes over homozygous dominant individuals, who are more vulnerable to the effects of malaria, and also over homozygous recessive individuals, who develop sickle-cell disease.
S			1.23.2.1.3.2	If only one allele exists for a particular locus in a population, that allele is said to be fixed in the gene pool, and all individuals are homozygous for that allele.
S			1.56.2.1.1.2.4	Inbreeding often reduces fitness because offspring are more likely to be homozygous for harmful recessive traits.
S			1.23.3.2.1.2.3	Apparently, one of the colonists carried a recessive allele for retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive form of blindness that afflicts homozygous individuals.
S			1.15.3.2.2.3.3	Fertilization of these various classes of eggs by homozygous recessive sperm (b vg) produced an offspring population in which 17% exhibited a nonparental, recombinant phenotype, reflecting combinations of alleles not seen before in either P generation parent.
S			1.23.4.4.2.3.2	In homozygous individuals, a certain recessive allele at that locus causes sickle-cell disease.
S			1.14.3.1.1.9.1	Although you might assume that the dominant allele for a particular character would be more common in a population than the recessive allele, this is not a given.
S			1.14.3.1.1.9.4	The low frequency of polydactyly indicates that the recessive allele, which results in five digits per appendage, is far more prevalent than the dominant allele in the population.

Q	What is generally a part of intrasexual selection?
A	"Male-male competition"
S			1.23.4.3.3.8	Intrasexual selection has also been observed among females in a variety of species, including ring-tailed lemurs and broad-nosed pipefish.
S			4.2705.1.1	Intrasexual selection is a direct competition among individuals of one sex (usually the males in vertebrates) for mates of the opposite sex.
S			1.51.3.2.3.1.2	Recall from that chapter that sexual selection can take the form of intersexual selection, in which members of one sex choose mates on the basis of characteristics of the other sex, such as courtship songs, or intrasexual selection, which involves competition between members of one sex for mates.
S			1.23.4.3.3.4	In many species, intrasexual selection occurs among males.
S			1.23.4.3.3.3	In intrasexual selection, meaning selection within the same sex, individuals of one sex compete directly for mates of the opposite sex.
S			1.23.4.3.1.3	There is intrasexual selection between competing males, followed by intersexual selection when the females choose among the showiest males.
S			1.20.4.2.4.2	The forensic scientist tests only a few selected portions of the DNA: usually 13 STR markers.
S			1.23.4.1.1.2.1	Although we often refer to the relative fitness of a genotype, remember that the entity that is subjected to natural selection is the whole organism, not the underlying genotype.
S			1.23.4.4.1	The Key Role of Natural Selection in Adaptive Evolution
S			1.22.2.2.2.1.3	By selecting variations in different parts of the plant, breeders have obtained these divergent results.

Q	The effect of genetic drift is larger in what kinds of populations?
A	"Small"
S			1.23.3.2.2.2.4	Ongoing genetic drift is likely to have substantial effects on the gene pool until the population becomes large enough that chance events have less impact.
S			4.2049.1.1	Genetic drift that occurs when a few individuals become isolated from a larger population and form a new population whose gene pool composition is not reflective of that of the original population.
S			1.23.3.2.3.4.7	Overall, studies on the Illinois greater prairie chicken illustrate the powerful effects of genetic drift in small populations and provide hope that in at least some populations, these effects can be reversed.
S			4.2178.1.2	Effects of genetic drift are most pronounced in small populations.
S			1.23.3.2.1.1.3	Genetic drift, in which chance events alter allele frequencies, will occur in such a case if the storm indiscriminately transports some individuals (and their alleles), but not others, from the source population.
S			1.56.2.1.3.1.3	Large predators that feed high on the food chain usually require extensive individual ranges, resulting in low population densities.
S			1.23.3.2.4.1	Certain circumstances can result in genetic drift having a significant impact on a population.
S			1.23.0.0.3.3	In fact, there are three main mechanisms that can cause allele frequency change: natural selection, genetic drift (chance events that alter allele frequencies), and gene flow (the transfer of alleles between populations).
S			1.23.3.2.1.5	Chance events can also cause allele frequencies to fluctuate unpredictably from one generation to the next, especially in small populations: a process called genetic drift.
S			1.56.2.1.1.2.3	Both inbreeding and genetic drift can cause a loss of genetic variation (see Chapter 23), and their effects become more harmful as a population shrinks.

Q	What is a founder effect caused by?
A	"Small population"
S			1.1.2.3.2.1	Darwin proposed that natural selection, by its cumulative effects over long periods of time, could cause an ancestral species to give rise to two or more descendant species.
S			1.3.2.2.3.2.4	Water's high heat of vaporization is another emergent property resulting from the strength of its hydrogen bonds, which must be broken before the molecules can make their exodus from the liquid.
S			4.1441.1.1	Developmental genetics studies the effect that genes have in a phenotype, given normal or abnormal epigenetic parameters.
S			4.3248.1.1	Developmental genetics of mouse studies the effect that genes have in a phenotype, given normal or abnormal epigenetic parameters.
S			4.5522.1.1	Developmental genetics of zebrafish studies the effect that genes have in a phenotype, given normal or abnormal epigenetic parameters.
S			1.15.5.1.1.1	Throughout our discussions of Mendelian genetics and the chromosomal basis of inheritance, we have assumed that a given allele will have the same effect whether it was inherited from the mother or the father.
S			1.23.3.2.1.2.5	The frequency of the allele that causes this disease is ten times higher on Tristan da Cunha than in the populations from which the founders came.
S			1.25.5.2.2.19.1	Given that changes in morphology are often caused by changes in the regulation of gene expression, predict whether noncoding DNA is likely to be affected by natural selection.
S			1.5.4.2.1.3	He used agents that break polypeptides at specific places, followed by chemical methods to determine the amino acid sequence in these small fragments.
S			1.23.3.2.4.1.6	Thus, unlike natural selection, which in a given environment consistently favors some alleles over others, genetic drift causes allele frequencies to change at random over time.

Q	What is a founder effected caused by?
A	"New population"
S			1.1.2.3.2.1	Darwin proposed that natural selection, by its cumulative effects over long periods of time, could cause an ancestral species to give rise to two or more descendant species.
S			1.3.2.2.3.2.4	Water's high heat of vaporization is another emergent property resulting from the strength of its hydrogen bonds, which must be broken before the molecules can make their exodus from the liquid.
S			4.1441.1.1	Developmental genetics studies the effect that genes have in a phenotype, given normal or abnormal epigenetic parameters.
S			4.3248.1.1	Developmental genetics of mouse studies the effect that genes have in a phenotype, given normal or abnormal epigenetic parameters.
S			4.5522.1.1	Developmental genetics of zebrafish studies the effect that genes have in a phenotype, given normal or abnormal epigenetic parameters.
S			1.15.5.1.1.1	Throughout our discussions of Mendelian genetics and the chromosomal basis of inheritance, we have assumed that a given allele will have the same effect whether it was inherited from the mother or the father.
S			1.23.3.2.1.2.5	The frequency of the allele that causes this disease is ten times higher on Tristan da Cunha than in the populations from which the founders came.

S			1.5.4.2.1.3	He used agents that break polypeptides at specific places, followed by chemical methods to determine the amino acid sequence in these small fragments.
S			1.23.3.2.4.1.6	Thus, unlike natural selection, which in a given environment consistently favors some alleles over others, genetic drift causes allele frequencies to change at random over time.

Q	What is gene flow caused by?
A	"Migration"
S			1.24.1.1.2.2.9	As we'll discuss, natural selection can cause such species to remain distinct even though some gene flow occurs between them.
S			1.23.3.8.6	The three mechanisms that alter allele frequencies directly and cause most evolutionary change are natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow (violations of conditions 3-5).
S			1.23.0.0.3.3	In fact, there are three main mechanisms that can cause allele frequency change: natural selection, genetic drift (chance events that alter allele frequencies), and gene flow (the transfer of alleles between populations).
S			1.24.4.1.2.15.6	Furthermore, once gene flow is interrupted, the populations must diverge genetically to such an extent that they become reproductively isolated: all before other events cause gene flow to resume, possibly reversing the speciation process (see Figure 24.16).
S			1.23.3.3.4.1	Finally, gene flow has become an increasingly important agent of evolutionary change in human populations.
S			4.2154.1.1	Gene flow is the transfer of alleles from one population to another, resulting from the movement of fertile individuals or their gametes.
S			1.23.3.3.1.2	Allele frequencies can also change by gene flow, the transfer of alleles into or out of a population due to the movement of fertile individuals or their gametes.
S			4.2485.1.1	A huntington's chorea is a human genetic disease caused by a dominant allele; characterized by uncontrollable body movements and degeneration of the nervous system; usually fatal 10 to 20 years after the onset of symptoms.
S			1.24.2.3.6.2	Describe two mechanisms that can decrease gene flow in sympatric populations, thereby making sympatric speciation more likely to occur.
S			1.24.2.2.1.3	Although such contact (and the ongoing gene flow that results) makes sympatric speciation less common than allopatric speciation, sympatric speciation can occur if gene flow is reduced by such factors as polyploidy, habitat differentiation, and sexual selection.

Q	What effect can gene flow have on genetic variation?
A	"Increase"
S			1.27.2.2.2.5.5	This results in the production of a recombinant bacterium that has genes derived from two different cells: a new genetic variant on which evolution can act.
S			4.3761.1.1	A phenotypic ratio is a ratio that shows the different outcomes you can get from a genetic cross   A ratio that shows the varied outcomes that results from a genetic cross and is based on physical appearance alone.
S			1.56.2.1.1.2.3	Both inbreeding and genetic drift can cause a loss of genetic variation (see Chapter 23), and their effects become more harmful as a population shrinks.
S			1.17.5.6.2	If the mutation has an adverse effect on the phenotype of an organism, the mutant condition is referred to as a genetic disorder or hereditary disease.
S			1.23.3.8.5	Nonrandom mating (violation of condition 2) can affect the frequencies of homozygous and heterozygous genotypes but by itself usually has no effect on allele frequencies in the gene pool.
S			1.23.3.2.4.1	Certain circumstances can result in genetic drift having a significant impact on a population.
S			1.23.0.0.3.3	In fact, there are three main mechanisms that can cause allele frequency change: natural selection, genetic drift (chance events that alter allele frequencies), and gene flow (the transfer of alleles between populations).
S			1.23.1.2.2.2.3	Gene duplications that do not have severe effects can persist over generations, allowing mutations to accumulate.
S			1.17.5.1.1.4.3	This is called a nonsense mutation, and it causes translation to be terminated prematurely; the resulting polypeptide will be shorter than the polypeptide encoded by the normal gene.
S			1.23.1.2.1.2.1	A change of as little as one base in a gene, called a "point mutation," can have a significant impact on phenotype, as in sickle-cell disease (see Figure 17.23).

Q	What is the Biological Species Concept unable to classify?
A	"Fossils"
S			1.24.1.2.3.4	Of course, the difficulty with this species concept is determining the degree of difference required to indicate separate species.
S			1.24.5.4.2	The biological species concept emphasizes reproductive isolation through prezygotic and postzygotic barriers that separate gene pools.
S			1.24.1.1.2.2.10	This observation has led some researchers to argue that the biological species concept overemphasizes gene flow and downplays the role of natural selection.
S			1.24.5.4.1	A biological species is a group of populations whose individuals have the potential to interbreed and produce viable, fertile offspring with each other but not with members of other species.
S			1.1.2.1.1.2.4	Taxonomy, the branch of biology that names and classifies species, formalizes this ordering of species into groups of increasing breadth, based on the degree to which they share characteristics (Figure 1.14).
S			1.24.5.5.1	Explain the importance of gene flow to the biological species concept.
S			1.24.1.1.1.1	Figure 24.2 The biological species concept is based on the potential to interbreed rather than on physical similarity.
S			1.24.1.1.2.2.11	Because of the limitations to the biological species concept, alternative species concepts are useful in certain situations.
S			1.24.1.1.2.2.4	The biological species concept also does not apply to organisms that reproduce asexually all or most of the time, such as prokaryotes.
S			1.24.1.1.2.2.1	One strength of the biological species concept is that it directs our attention to how speciation occurs: by the evolution of reproductive isolation.

Q	What is the Morphological Species Concept unable to distinguish?
A	"Convergent evolution"
S			1.24.1.2.1.3	The morphological species concept can be applied to asexual and sexual organisms, and it can be useful even without information on the extent of gene flow.
S			1.28.8.6.1	Key Concept/Eukaryote Supergroup Major Groups Key Morphological  Characteristics Specific Examples
S			1.51.3.2.1.2.2	Among monogamous species, males and females are often so much alike morphologically that they may be difficult or impossible to distinguish based on external characteristics.
S			1.18.4.4.3.15.5	Finally, the principle that a gradient of morphogens can determine polarity and position has proved to be a key developmental concept for a number of species, just as early embryologists had thought.
S			1.24.1.2.3.4	Of course, the difficulty with this species concept is determining the degree of difference required to indicate separate species.
S			1.24.1.2.1.5	One disadvantage, however, is that this definition relies on subjective criteria; researchers may disagree on which structural features distinguish a species.
S			1.24.1.2.3.3	Such analyses can distinguish groups of individuals that are sufficiently different to be considered separate species.
S			1.32.3.8.1	Animal species vary tremendously in morphology, but their great diversity in form can be described by a relatively small number of major "body plans.
S			1.24.1.2.1.2	For example, the morphological species concept characterizes a species by body shape and other structural features.
S			4.3236.1.1	A morphological species concept is a definition of species in terms of measurable anatomical criteria.

Q	What is necessary for parapatric speciation to occur?
A	"Limited geographic overlap"	"Limited gene flow"
S			1.24.4.1.2.15.6	Furthermore, once gene flow is interrupted, the populations must diverge genetically to such an extent that they become reproductively isolated: all before other events cause gene flow to resume, possibly reversing the speciation process (see Figure 24.16).
S			1.24.4.5.1	From Speciation to Macroevolution
S			1.24.5.31.1	speciation is usually due to a single mutation.
S			4.2210.1.1	A geographic barrier is a in relation with to speciation.
S			1.24.4.6.3	But biologists since Darwin have continued to ask fundamental questions about speciation.
S			1.25.7.10.2	These changes lead to extinctions in some groups of organisms and bursts of speciation in others.
S			1.24.4.6.1	Darwin faced many unanswered questions when he began to ponder that "mystery of mysteries": speciation.
S			1.24.5.10.3	New developments in genetics have enabled researchers to identify specific genes involved in some cases of speciation.
S			1.24.3.2.2.1.3	In effect, the speciation process reverses, eventually causing the two hybridizing species to fuse into a single species.
S			1.24.5.10.2	The time interval between speciation events varies considerably, from a few thousand years to tens of millions of years.

Q	What is an example of pre-zygotic reproductive isolation?
A	"Temporal isolation"	"Habitat isolation"	"Behavioral isolation"	"Mechanical isolation"	"Gametic isolation"
S			1.24.1.1.1.2.5	If a sperm cell from one species overcomes prezygotic barriers and fertilizes an ovum from another species, a variety of postzygotic barriers ("after the zygote") may contribute to reproductive isolation after the hybrid zygote is formed.
S			1.24.1.1.2.2.3	There is, for example, no way to evaluate the reproductive isolation of fossils.
S			1.24.4.2.2.1	In a few cases, the evolution of reproductive isolation is due to a change in a single gene.
S			1.24.4.1.1.3.6	For species whose fossils changed much more gradually, we also cannot tell exactly when a new biological species formed, since information about reproductive isolation does not fossilize.
S			1.24.4.2.1.1	Studies of ongoing speciation (as in hybrid zones) can reveal traits that cause reproductive isolation.
S			1.24.4.2.4.6	Thus, a mutation at a single locus can influence pollinator preference and hence contribute to reproductive isolation in monkey flowers.
S			1.24.4.2.5.3	Overall, studies suggest that few or many genes can influence the evolution of reproductive isolation and hence the emergence of a new species.
S			4.4013.1.1	A postzygotic barrier is a reproductive barrier that prevent hybrid zygotes produced by two different species from developing into viable, fertile adults.
S			1.24.5.4.1	24.1 The biological species concept emphasizes reproductive isolation.
S			1.47.1.2.2.1.4	For example, when half the normal amount of cytoplasm surrounds the newly formed zygotic nucleus, one fewer cleavage division occurs, consistent with the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio reaching the threshold after one fewer cell cycle.

Q	What is an example of post-zygotic reproductive isolation?
A	"Zygote mortality"	"Non-viable hybrids"	"Hybrid sterility"
S			1.24.1.1.1.2.5	If a sperm cell from one species overcomes prezygotic barriers and fertilizes an ovum from another species, a variety of postzygotic barriers ("after the zygote") may contribute to reproductive isolation after the hybrid zygote is formed.
S			1.24.1.1.2.2.3	There is, for example, no way to evaluate the reproductive isolation of fossils.
S			4.2490.1.1	A hybrid reduced viability is a post zygotic reproctive barrier resulting from genetic incompatibility between the two species.
S			1.24.4.2.2.1	In a few cases, the evolution of reproductive isolation is due to a change in a single gene.
S			1.51.5.8.1	An optimal foraging model is based on the idea that natural selection should favor foraging behavior that minimizes the costs of foraging and maximizes the benefits.
S			1.24.2.2.3.2.4	Their results suggest that mate choice based on male breeding coloration is the main reproductive barrier that normally keeps the gene pools of these two species separate.
S			1.24.4.2.4.6	Thus, a mutation at a single locus can influence pollinator preference and hence contribute to reproductive isolation in monkey flowers.
S			1.24.4.2.1.1	Studies of ongoing speciation (as in hybrid zones) can reveal traits that cause reproductive isolation.
S			1.24.4.2.5.3	Overall, studies suggest that few or many genes can influence the evolution of reproductive isolation and hence the emergence of a new species.
S			1.24.4.1.1.3.6	For species whose fossils changed much more gradually, we also cannot tell exactly when a new biological species formed, since information about reproductive isolation does not fossilize.

Q	What aspect of a cline allows species interaction while maintaining the identity of both species?
A	"Niche gradient"	"Gradient of biocommunities"
S			1.20.2.3.2.12.3	Ultimately, information from DNA microarray assays should provide a grander view of how ensembles of genes interact to form an organism and maintain its vital systems.
S			1.40.5.6.1	Faced with environmental fluctuations, animals regulate (control) certain internal variables while allowing other internal variables to conform to (correspond to) external changes.
S			1.21.2.3.1.1	The impressive computational power provided by the tools of bioinformatics allows the study of whole sets of genes and their interactions, as well as the comparison of genomes from different species.
S			1.52.4.4.2.1.3	Terrestrial organisms face a nearly constant threat of desiccation, and the distribution of terrestrial species reflects their ability to obtain and conserve water.

S			1.9.5.2.2.4	In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is oxygen; in anaerobic respiration, the final acceptor is another molecule that is electronegative (although invariably less so than oxygen).
S			1.10.1.3.4.4	The electron acceptor NADP+ is first cousin to NAD+, which functions as an electron carrier in cellular respiration; the two molecules differ only by the presence of an extra phosphate group in the NADP+ molecule.
S			1.9.4.1.3.3	Electrons removed from glucose by NAD+, during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are transferred from NADH to the first molecule of the electron transport chain in complex I. This molecule is a flavoprotein, so named because it has a prosthetic group called flavin mononucleotide (FMN).
S			1.9.1.2.3.2.2	Enzymes called dehydrogenases remove a pair of hydrogen atoms (2 electrons and 2 protons) from the substrate (glucose, in this example), thereby oxidizing it.

Q	What is the difference between oxidizing glucose via combustion versus oxidizing glucose in cells?
A	"Glucose is oxidized in steps in cells."
S			1.9.1.2.3.1.3	Cellular respiration does not oxidize glucose in a single explosive step either.
S			1.9.1.2.2.4.6	Instead, if you swallow some glucose, enzymes in your cells will lower the barrier of activation energy, allowing the sugar to be oxidized in a series of steps.
S			1.9.3.3.2	If molecular oxygen is present, the pyruvate enters a mitochondrion (in eukaryotic cells), where the oxidation of glucose is completed.
S			1.9.1.2.2.2.1	As in the combustion of methane or gasoline, the fuel (glucose) is oxidized and oxygen is reduced.
S			1.9.6.1.3.3	Similarly, glycogen, the polysaccharide that humans and many other animals store in their liver and muscle cells, can be hydrolyzed to glucose between meals as fuel for respiration.
S			4.4186.1.4	It can be made from glucose through glycolysis, supplies energy to living cells in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and can also be converted to carbohydrates via gluconeogenesis, to fatty acids or energy through acetyl-CoA, to the amino acid alanine and to ethanol.
S			1.9.1.2.3.3.3	NAD+ is the most versatile electron acceptor in cellular respiration and functions in several of the redox steps during the breakdown of glucose.
S			1.9.1.2.3.7.1	In summary, during cellular respiration, most electrons travel the following "downhill" route: glucose&rarr; NADH&rarr; electron transport chain&rarr; oxygen.
S			1.27.7.7.2	Genetic diversity in prokaryotes also can arise by recombination of the DNA from two different cells (via transformation, transduction, or conjugation).
S			1.11.1.2.2.5	Moreover, animal cells may communicate via direct contact between membrane-bound cell-surface molecules in a process called cell-cell recognition (Figure 11.4b).

Q	What form does the released energy from glucose oxidation via cellular respiration take?
A	"ATP."
S			1.9.2.2.3	This investment is repaid with interest during the energy payoff phase, when ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation and NAD+ is reduced to NADH by electrons released from the oxidation of glucose.
S			1.9.1.3.7.1	For each molecule of glucose degraded to carbon dioxide and water by respiration, the cell makes up to about 32 molecules of ATP, each with 7.3 kcal/mol of free energy.
S			1.10.1.2.2.1.3	During cellular respiration, energy is released from sugar when electrons associated with hydrogen are transported by carriers to oxygen, forming water as a by-product (see p. 164).
S			4.4186.1.4	It can be made from glucose through glycolysis, supplies energy to living cells in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and can also be converted to carbohydrates via gluconeogenesis, to fatty acids or energy through acetyl-CoA, to the amino acid alanine and to ethanol.
S			1.9.1.3.5.4	The energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion (or prokaryotic cell) can use to make ATP from ADP.
S			1.8.2.3.2.6.2	Cellular respiration uses glucose and oxygen, which have high levels of free energy, and releases CO2 and water, which have low levels of free energy.
S			4.5088.1.3	Electron transport chains are the cellular mechanisms used for extracting energy from sunlight in photosynthesis and also from redox reactions, such as the oxidation of sugars (respiration).
S			1.7.6.60.1	A human pancreatic cell obtains O2, fuel molecules such as glucose, and building materials such as amino acids and cholesterol from its environment, and it releases CO2 as a waste product of cellular respiration.
S			1.9.1.3.2.2	We include glycolysis, however, because most respiring cells deriving energy from glucose use glycolysis to produce the starting material for the citric acid cycle.
S			1.9.1.3.1.1	The harvesting of energy from glucose by cellular respiration is a cumulative function of three metabolic stages:

Q	How long would it take for a cell to use up its supply of ATP if it weren't renewed?
A	"30-V60 seconds."
S			1.9.1.2.3.7.2	Later in this chapter, you will learn more about how the cell uses the energy released from this exergonic electron fall to regenerate its supply of ATP.
S			1.9.5.4.1	Because most of the ATP generated by cellular respiration is due to the work of oxidative phosphorylation, our estimate of ATP yield from aerobic respiration is contingent on an adequate supply of oxygen to the cell.
S			1.6.7.4.2.1	From our panoramic view of the cell's compartmental organization to our close-up inspection of each organelle's architecture, this tour of the cell has provided many opportunities to correlate structure with function.
S			1.9.1.1.9.3	To keep working, the cell must regenerate its supply of ATP from ADP andi (see Figure 8.11).
S			1.9.4.3.8.7	In the absence of such an adaptation, the ATP level would build up to a point that cellular respiration would be shut down due to regulatory mechanisms to be discussed later.
S			1.41.1.11.3	To meet the continuous requirement for ATP, animals ingest and digest nutrients, including carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, for use in cellular respiration and energy storage.
S			1.9.5.3.1.2	Ancient prokaryotes are thought to have used glycolysis to make ATP long before oxygen was present in Earth's atmosphere.
S			1.9.0.0.2.8	In this chapter, we consider how cells harvest the chemical energy stored in organic molecules and use it to generate ATP, the molecule that drives most cellular work.
S			1.9.1.3.5.4	The energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion (or prokaryotic cell) can use to make ATP from ADP.
S			1.8.3.3.1.2	Energy released by breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell is used to phosphorylate ADP, regenerating ATP.

Q	Where does most of the glucose used for making ATP come from?
A	"Plants and other photosynthetic species."
S			4.1942.1.1	Fermentation is a catabolic process that makes a limited amount of ATP from glucose without an electron transport chain and that produces a characteristic end product, such as ethyl alcohol or lactic acid.
S			1.9.1.3.2.2	We include glycolysis, however, because most respiring cells deriving energy from glucose use glycolysis to produce the starting material for the citric acid cycle.
S			1.9.5.6.7	If oxygen is present, then additional ATP is made by oxidative phosphorylation when NADH passes electrons removed from glucose to the electron transport chain.
S			1.9.4.3.2.6	Each NADH that transfers a pair of electrons from glucose to the electron transport chain contributes enough to the proton-motive force to generate a maximum of about 3 ATP.
S			1.9.4.4.2	But the metabolic components of respiration we have dissected so far, glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, produce only 4 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, all by substrate-level phosphorylation: 2 net ATP from glycolysis and 2 ATP from the citric acid cycle.
S			1.9.2.2.3	This investment is repaid with interest during the energy payoff phase, when ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation and NAD+ is reduced to NADH by electrons released from the oxidation of glucose.
S			1.9.7.17.1	About 34% of the energy stored in a glucose molecule is transferred to ATP during cellular respiration, producing a maximum of about 32 ATP.
S			1.9.1.3.7.1	For each molecule of glucose degraded to carbon dioxide and water by respiration, the cell makes up to about 32 molecules of ATP, each with 7.3 kcal/mol of free energy.
S			1.9.4.3.6.5	Thus, about 34% of the potential chemical energy in glucose has been transferred to ATP; the actual percentage is probably higher because deltaG is lower under cellular conditions.
S			1.10.3.9.2	Explain why the large numbers of ATP and NADPH molecules used during the Calvin cycle are consistent with the high value of glucose as an energy source.

Q	How does the glucose synthesized via photosynthesis reach consumers like animals, fungi, and bacteria?
A	"Via decomposition or ingestion."
S			1.31.1.1.1.1	Like animals, fungi are heterotrophs: They cannot make their own food as plants and algae can.
S			1.28.4.3.2.3	The predators include the most important consumers of bacteria in aquatic and soil ecosystems, along with species that eat other protists, fungi, and even small animals.
S			4.249.1.1	Animal is a kingdom of organisms like Plant, fungi and bacteria
S			1.26.6.1.1.4	Fungi, too, were classified as plants, partly because most fungi, like most plants, are unable to move about.
S			1.11.1.2.2.1	Like bacteria or yeast cells, cells in a multicellular organism usually communicate via chemical messengers targeted for cells that may or may not be immediately adjacent.
S			1.1.1.6.2.2.3	The entire sequence of nucleotides in the human genome is now known, along with the genome sequences of many other organisms, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and other animals.

S			1.55.0.0.4.6	The elements are returned in inorganic form to the environment by the metabolism of plants and animals and by organisms such as bacteria and fungi that break down organic wastes and dead organisms.
S			1.43.1.1.3.2	Fungal cell walls contain certain unique polysaccharides, whereas bacterial cell walls have polymers containing combinations of sugars and amino acids not found in animal cells.
S			1.43.1.2.2.1.3	Lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, CpG DNA (DNA containing unmethylated CG sequences), and double-stranded (ds) RNA are all found in bacteria, fungi, or viruses, but not in animal cells.

Q	How many pyruvate molecules are made per glucose molecule?
A	"Two."
S			1.9.3.2.1.3	To calculate on a per-glucose basis, multiply by 2, because each glucose molecule is split during glycolysis into two pyruvate molecules.
S			1.10.5.18.2	One molecule of G3P exits the cycle per three CO2 molecules fixed and is converted to glucose and other organic molecules.
S			1.9.5.2.2.9	In fact, aerobic respiration yields up to 16 times as much ATP per glucose molecule as does fermentation: up to 32 molecules of ATP for respiration, compared with 2 molecules of ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation in fermentation.
S			1.9.4.4.2	But the metabolic components of respiration we have dissected so far, glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, produce only 4 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, all by substrate-level phosphorylation: 2 net ATP from glycolysis and 2 ATP from the citric acid cycle.
S			1.9.5.6.4	Glycolysis oxidizes glucose to two molecules of pyruvate.
S			1.9.2.1.3	These smaller sugars are then oxidized and their remaining atoms rearranged to form two molecules of pyruvate.
S			1.9.1.3.3.2	Glycolysis, which occurs in the cytosol, begins the degradation process by breaking glucose into two molecules of a compound called pyruvate.
S			1.9.2.3.1	All of the carbon originally present in glucose is accounted for in the two molecules of pyruvate; no carbon is released as CO2 during glycolysis.
S			1.9.3.3.1	Glycolysis releases less than a quarter of the chemical energy in glucose that can be released by cells; most of the energy remains stockpiled in the two molecules of pyruvate.
S			1.9.2.2.4	The net energy yield from glycolysis, per glucose molecule, is 2 ATP plus 2 NADH.

Q	What is the only step of cellular respiration that takes place in the cytoplasm of a cell?
A	"Glycolysis."
S			4.1653.1.1	An electron carrier of cellular respiration is a coenzyme that accepts electrons stripped from glucose at various steps of cellular respiration, then gives them up in the electron transport chain.

S			4.3131.1.1	A microfilament is a cable composed of actin proteins in the cytoplasm of almost every eukaryotic cell, making up part of the cytoskeleton and acting alone or with myosin to cause cell contraction; also known as an actin filament.
S			1.40.4.2.3.2	Because nearly all of the chemical energy used in cellular respiration eventually appears as heat, metabolic rate can be measured by monitoring an animal's rate of heat loss.

S			4.4253.1.1	Receptor proteins located in the cytoplasm, cell membrane, or nuclear membrane bind to another molecule leading to a change in cell behavior.
S			1.15.5.2.1.1	Although our focus in this chapter has been on the chromosomal basis of inheritance, we end with an important amendment: Not all of a eukaryotic cell's genes are located on nuclear chromosomes, or even in the nucleus; some genes are located in organelles in the cytoplasm.
S			1.42.7.2.1.2.4	When cells in a particular location begin working harder: during exercise, for instance: PO2 dips in their vicinity as the O2 is consumed in cellular respiration.
S			1.10.4.2.3.1	The first step is carried out by an enzyme present only in mesophyll cells called PEP carboxylase.
S			1.9.1.2.3.1.3	Cellular respiration does not oxidize glucose in a single explosive step either.

S			1.27.7.7.2	Genetic diversity in prokaryotes also can arise by recombination of the DNA from two different cells (via transformation, transduction, or conjugation).
S			1.12.2.4.1.1	Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) can undergo a type of reproduction in which the cell grows to roughly double its size and then divides to form two cells.
S			1.9.6.1.2.4	All these organic molecules in food can be used by cellular respiration to make ATP (Figure 9.19).
S			1.9.5.1.4.6	Because oxygen is available, this pyruvate can then enter the mitochondria in liver cells and complete cellular respiration.
S			1.10.1.2.5.1	Writing the equation in this form, we can see that the overall chemical change during photosynthesis is the reverse of the one that occurs during cellular respiration.

Q	What happens to pyruvate during pyruvate processing, also known as the linking step?
A	"Pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA."
S			1.9.3.1.2.2	This step, linking glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, is carried out by a multienzyme complex that catalyzes three reactions: &#x278A; Pyruvate's carboxyl group (: COO-'), which is already fully oxidized and thus has little chemical energy, is removed and given off as a molecule of CO2.
S			1.49.5.2.2.3	In its milder forms, this phase is sometimes associated with great creativity, and some well-known artists, musicians, and literary figures (including Vincent Van Gogh, Robert Schumann, Virginia Woolf, and Ernest Hemingway, to name a few) have had very productive periods during manic phases.

S			1.15.4.3.1.3.4	Most cases result from nondisjunction during meiosis I, and some research points to an age-dependent abnormality in a meiosis checkpoint that normally delays anaphase until all the kinetochores are attached to the spindle (like the M phase checkpoint of the mitotic cell cycle; see Chapter 12).
S			4.3146.1.2	This process is useful in movement of chromosomes attached to the microtubules during cell division
S			1.17.3.2.2.2.2	Many genes are known to give rise to two or more different polypeptides, depending on which segments are treated as exons during RNA processing; this is called alternative RNA splicing (see Figure 18.13).
S			1.8.6.10.2	The change in free energy (deltaG) during a biological process is related directly to enthalpy change (deltaH) and to the change in entropy (deltaS): deltaG = deltaH - TdeltaS.

S			1.11.3.2.2.5	Each such shape change results from the interaction of the newly added phosphate groups with charged or polar amino acids (see Figure 5.16).

Q	How many reactions make up glycolysis?

S			1.9.3.1.2.2	This step, linking glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, is carried out by a multienzyme complex that catalyzes three reactions: &#x278A; Pyruvate's carboxyl group (: COO-'), which is already fully oxidized and thus has little chemical energy, is removed and given off as a molecule of CO2.
S			4.2495.1.1	In organic chemistry, a hydration reaction is a chemical reaction in which a hydroxyl group (OH-) and a hydrogen cation (an acidic proton) are added to the two carbon atoms bonded together in the carbon-carbon double bond which makes up an alkene functional group.
S			1.11.6.6.4	Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) react to the binding of signaling molecules by forming dimers and then adding phosphate groups to tyrosines on the cytoplasmic part of the other monomer making up the dimer.
S			1.10.2.7.1.15	At least three steps in the light reactions contribute to the proton gradient: &#x278A; Water is split by photosystem II on the side of the membrane facing the thylakoid space; &#x278B; as plastoquinone (Pq), a mobile carrier, transfers electrons to the cytochrome complex, four protons are translocated across the membrane into the thylakoid space; and &#x278C; a hydrogen ion is removed from the stroma when it is taken up by NADP+.

Q	Why doesn't glycolysis produce 4 net ATP per glucose molecule?
A	"2 ATP were spent to begin glycolysis."
S			1.9.4.4.2	But the metabolic components of respiration we have dissected so far, glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, produce only 4 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, all by substrate-level phosphorylation: 2 net ATP from glycolysis and 2 ATP from the citric acid cycle.

S			4.3777.1.1	Phosphofructokinase is the enzyme that catalyzes step 3 of glycolysis.
S			1.9.6.3.1.8	Phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes an early step in glycolysis (see Figure 9.9), is one such enzyme.
S			1.9.3.1.2.2	This step, linking glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, is carried out by a multienzyme complex that catalyzes three reactions: &#x278A; Pyruvate's carboxyl group (: COO-'), which is already fully oxidized and thus has little chemical energy, is removed and given off as a molecule of CO2.

S			1.9.1.3.3.1	As diagrammed in Figure 9.6, glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation followed by the citric acid cycle are the catabolic pathways that break down glucose and other organic fuels.
S			1.9.1.1.5.1	Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be processed and consumed as fuel, it is helpful to learn the steps of cellular respiration by tracking the degradation of the sugar glucose (C6H12O6):
S			1.9.6.1.3.2	In the digestive tract, starch is hydrolyzed to glucose, which can then be broken down in the cells by glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.
S			1.9.1.3.7.2	Respiration cashes in the large denomination of energy banked in a single molecule of glucose (686 kcal/mol) for the small change of many molecules of ATP, which is more practical for the cell to spend on its work.

S			1.9.1.3.2.2	We include glycolysis, however, because most respiring cells deriving energy from glucose use glycolysis to produce the starting material for the citric acid cycle.

Q	Why is feedback inhibition a desirable check on ATP synthesis?
A	"Reserves glucose for ATP shortages."
S			1.8.5.1.3.2.1	When ATP allosterically inhibits an enzyme in an ATP-generating pathway, as we discussed earlier, the result is feedback inhibition, a common mode of metabolic control.
S			1.45.3.2.1.4.2	Without sufficient iodine, the thyroid gland cannot synthesize adequate amounts of T3 and T4, and the resulting low blood levels of T3 and T4 cannot exert the usual negative feedback on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary (see Figure 45.17).

S			4.151.1.1	Allosteric enzymes are enzymes which are regulated by the binding of regulatory molecules on sites separate from the active site.
S			1.8.5.1.2.1.5	(An active site may be similar to the active site in another, related enzyme, whereas allosteric regulatory sites appear to be quite distinct between enzymes. )
S			1.8.5.1.1.2.4	The binding of an activator to a regulatory site stabilizes the shape that has functional active sites, whereas the binding of an inhibitor stabilizes the inactive form of the enzyme.
S			1.8.5.1.1.2.6	Through this interaction of subunits, a single activator or inhibitor molecule that binds to one regulatory site will affect the active sites of all subunits.
S			1.8.6.27.1	Many enzymes are subject to allosteric regulation: Regulatory molecules, either activators or inhibitors, bind to specific regulatory sites, affecting the shape and function of the enzyme.
S			1.8.5.1.2.1.4	These molecules are attractive drug candidates for enzyme regulation because they exhibit higher specificity for particular enzymes than do inhibitors that bind to the active site.
S			1.8.5.2.7.2	Upon reading the scientific literature, you find that the enzyme's active site is similar to that of several other enzymes.
S			1.8.5.1.2.11.2	The data therefore support the existence of an allosteric inhibitory site on caspase 1 that can be used to control enzymatic activity.
S			1.8.5.1.1.2.1	Most enzymes known to be allosterically regulated are constructed from two or more subunits, each composed of a polypeptide chain with its own active site.
S			1.8.5.1.1.4.1	In another kind of allosteric activation, a substrate molecule binding to one active site in a multisubunit enzyme triggers a shape change in all the subunits, thereby increasing catalytic activity at the other active sites (Figure 8.19b).

Q	Would an individual with a mutation that gives the regulatory site on phosphofructokinase more affinity for ATP than the active site be expected to live very long?
A	"No, they can't perform efficient glycolysis."

S			1.56.1.1.2.1.10	According to a 2004 report in the journal Science that was based on a global assessment of amphibians by more than 500 scientists, 32% of all known amphibian species are endangered, with many species very near extinction.
S			1.30.3.4.3.6	This constraint can make it more likely that as an insect moves from flower to flower, pollen is placed on a part of the insect's body that will come into contact with the stigma of a flower of the same species.
S			1.14.3.4.3.6	In the last section of this chapter, we will apply Mendelian genetics to human inheritance, with emphasis on the transmission of hereditary diseases.
S			1.25.2.1.4.2	For instance, researchers seeking to discover a close ancestor of early terrestrial vertebrates predicted that such a fossil would most likely be located in a river bed (which would have sedimentary rocks) containing rocks that were 375 million years old (an age based on previously known fossils).
S			1.8.4.3.5.4	It has been known for more than 50 years that the active site itself is also not a rigid receptacle for the substrate.
S			1.8.5.1.1.2.1	Most enzymes known to be allosterically regulated are constructed from two or more subunits, each composed of a polypeptide chain with its own active site.
S			1.8.4.4.5.1	Third, the active site may also provide a microenvironment that is more conducive to a particular type of reaction than the solution itself would be without the enzyme.
S			1.1.2.2.5.2	He reasoned that individuals with inherited traits that are best suited to the local environment are more likely to survive and reproduce than less suited individuals.
S			1.39.4.2.5.8	In the case of Mimosa pudica, more violent stimuli, such as touching a leaf with a hot needle, causes all the leaves and leaflets on a plant to droop, but this whole-plant response involves the spread of signaling molecules released from the injured area to other parts of the shoot.

Q	How many membranes comprise a mitochondrion?
A	"Two."
S			1.6.5.1.3.6	Second, like prokaryotes, mitochondria and chloroplasts contain ribosomes, as well as circular DNA molecules attached to their inner membranes.
S			1.6.8.17.2	Mitochondrion Bounded by double membrane; inner membrane has infoldings (cristae) Cellular respiration Chloroplast Typically two membranes around fluid stroma, which contains thylakoids stacked into grana (in cells of photosynthetic eukaryotes, including plants) Photosynthesis Peroxisome Specialized metabolic compartment bounded by a single membrane Contains enzymes that transfer hydrogen atoms from substrates to oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a by-product; H2O2  is converted to water by another enzyme
S			1.6.5.3.3.1	The contents of a chloroplast are partitioned from the cytosol by an envelope consisting of two membranes separated by a very narrow intermembrane space.
S			1.11.5.2.1.3	One major pathway involves certain mitochondrial proteins that are triggered to form molecular pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane, causing it to leak and release other proteins that promote apoptosis.
S			1.6.5.2.2.3	The inner membrane divides the mitochondrion into two internal compartments.
S			1.9.3.2.2.12	In eukaryotic cells, all the citric acid cycle enzymes are located in the mitochondrial matrix except for the enzyme that catalyzes step 6, which resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
S			1.6.5.1.3.5	There is evidence that the ancestral engulfed prokaryotes had two outer membranes, which became the double membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts.
S			1.6.5.1.3.3	First, rather than being bounded by a single membrane like organelles of the endomembrane system, mitochondria and typical chloroplasts have two membranes surrounding them.
S			1.9.4.3.3.4	We know that 1 NADH results in 10 H+ being transported out across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but the exact number of H+ that must reenter the mitochondrial matrix via ATP synthase to generate 1 ATP has long been debated.
S			1.11.6.12.3	A protein (Ced-9) in the mitochondrial membrane acts as a brake; when released by a death signal, it allows activation of caspases, the main proteases that carry out apoptosis, and nucleases.

S			1.9.4.1.3.3	Electrons removed from glucose by NAD+, during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are transferred from NADH to the first molecule of the electron transport chain in complex I. This molecule is a flavoprotein, so named because it has a prosthetic group called flavin mononucleotide (FMN).
S			1.55.2.2.2.17.1	As a tool to remove carbon dioxide from air, iron fertilization remains controversial.

S			1.10.1.2.2.1.6	Water is split, and electrons are transferred along with hydrogen ions from the water to carbon dioxide, reducing it to sugar.

S			1.9.3.2.2.4	The cycle generates 1 ATP per turn by substrate-level phosphorylation, but most of the chemical energy is transferred to NAD+ and a related electron carrier, the coenzyme FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide, derived from riboflavin, a B vitamin), during the redox reactions.

Q	What kind of phosphorylation involves the coupling of oxidizing NADH and FADH2 with ATP production?
A	"Oxidative phosphorylation."
S			1.9.3.2.5.1	Most of the ATP produced by respiration results from oxidative phosphorylation, when the NADH and FADH2 produced by the citric acid cycle relay the electrons extracted from food to the electron transport chain.
S			1.9.2.2.3	This investment is repaid with interest during the energy payoff phase, when ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation and NAD+ is reduced to NADH by electrons released from the oxidation of glucose.
S			1.9.6.1.5.5	NADH and FADH2 are also generated during beta oxidation; they can enter the electron transport chain, leading to further ATP production.
S			1.9.4.2.2.6	Figure 9.15 Chemiosmosis couples the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis.
S			1.9.5.2.1.2	All three use glycolysis to oxidize glucose and other organic fuels to pyruvate, with a net production of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation.
S			1.9.4.3.3.3	First, phosphorylation and the redox reactions are not directly coupled to each other, so the ratio of the number of NADH molecules to the number of ATP molecules is not a whole number.
S			1.9.5.2.2.5	Passage of electrons from NADH to the electron transport chain not only regenerates the NAD+ required for glycolysis but pays an ATP bonus when the stepwise electron transport from this NADH to oxygen drives oxidative phosphorylation.
S			1.9.4.2.2.12	Note that FADH2 deposits its electrons via complex II and so results in fewer protons being pumped into the intermembrane space than occurs with NADH.
S			1.9.4.1.5.3	Consequently, although NADH and FADH2 each donate an equivalent number of electrons for oxygen reduction, the electron transport chain provides about one-third less energy for ATP synthesis when the electron donor is FADH2 rather than NADH.
S			4.4079.1.1	Oxidative phosphorylation in prokaryote is a metabolic pathway that uses energy released by the oxidation of nutrients to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in prokaryote.

Q	What happens to electrons as they travel further down the electron transport chain?
A	"They lose energy."
S			1.9.4.4.5	In this section, you will learn first how the electron transport chain works and then how electron flow down the chain is coupled to ATP synthesis.
S			1.9.4.2.5.4	Chloroplasts use chemiosmosis to generate ATP during photosynthesis; in these organelles, light (rather than chemical energy) drives both electron flow down an electron transport chain and the resulting H+ gradient formation.
S			1.9.5.2.2.3	In cellular respiration, by contrast, electrons carried by NADH are transferred to an electron transport chain, where they move stepwise down a series of redox reactions to a final electron acceptor.
S			1.9.4.1.2.1	Figure 9.13 shows the sequence of electron carriers in the electron transport chain and the drop in free energy as electrons travel down the chain.
S			1.9.1.2.3.6.4	Therefore, the electrons removed from glucose by NAD+ fall down an energy gradient in the electron transport chain to a far more stable location in the electronegative oxygen atom.
S			4.5174.1.2	In cyclic electron flow, electrons are transfered fromt he primary acceptor of photosystem II to the transport chain by plastoquinone.
S			1.9.4.1.1.8	The overall energy drop (deltaG) for electrons traveling from NADH to oxygen is 53 kcal/mol, but this "fall" is broken up into a series of smaller steps by the electron transport chain.
S			1.9.7.16.1	At certain steps along the electron transport chain, electron transfer causes protein complexes to move H+ from the mitochondrial matrix (in eukaryotes) to the intermembrane space, storing energy as a proton-motive force (H+ gradient).
S			1.9.5.4.2	Without the electronegative oxygen to pull electrons down the transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation eventually ceases.
S			1.10.1.2.2.1.4	The electrons lose potential energy as they "fall" down the electron transport chain toward electronegative oxygen, and the mitochondrion harnesses that energy to synthesize ATP (see Figure 9.15).

Q	What makes ubiquinone different from the rest of the molecules in the ETC?
A	"It is not a protein."
S			4.5154.1.1	Bacteria use two different strategies for transcription termination: in Rho-independent transcription termination, RNA transcription stops when the newly synthesized RNA molecule forms a G-C rich hairpin loop followed by a run of U's, which makes it detach from the DNA template.

Q	What signals act very quickly?
A	"Neural signals"
S			1.11.4.2.3.1.3	If this were true in the cell, signaling pathways would operate very inefficiently because most relay molecules are proteins, and proteins are too large to diffuse quickly through the viscous cytosol.

Q	What is the process of converting a signal to a different form?
A	"Signal transduction"

Q	What does the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP at G proteins do?
A	"Inactivates them"
S			1.11.3.3.1.5.6	Because the modified G protein is unable to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, it remains stuck in its active form, continuously stimulating adenylyl cyclase to make cAMP.
S			4.2108.1.1	A GDP is a nucleotide  typically found as the uncharged state that converts to GTP, for example, by interacting with G proteins during signal-transduction pathways.

A	"Yes"
S			1.39.1.7.14	As discussed in Chapter 11, a hormone or other kind of stimulus interacting with a specific receptor protein can trigger the sequential activation of relay proteins and also the production of second messengers that participate in the pathway.
S			1.11.4.1.2.9	This pathway amplifies the hormonal signal: One receptor protein can activate about 100 molecules of G protein, and each enzyme in the pathway, once activated, can act on many molecules of its substrate, the next molecule in the cascade.
S			1.11.4.2.2.3.5	In cell B, a pathway that is triggered by a single kind of signal diverges to produce two responses; such branched pathways often involve receptor tyrosine kinases (which can activate multiple relay proteins) or second messengers (which can regulate numerous proteins).

Q	What molecules deactivate signals?
A	"Enzymes"
S			1.11.4.2.4.2.6	Then, by a variety of means, the relay molecules return to their inactive forms: The GTPase activity intrinsic to a G protein hydrolyzes its bound GTP; the enzyme phosphodiesterase converts cAMP to AMP; protein phosphatases inactivate phosphorylated kinases and other proteins; and so forth.

Q	What is the process of programmed cell death?
A	"Apoptosis"
S			1.36.1.1.4.5	When this happens, the nonproductive leaves or branches undergo programmed cell death and are eventually shed, a process called self-pruning.
S			1.11.6.76.3	Write a short essay (about 100-150 words) that briefly explains the role of apoptosis in the development and proper functioning of an animal and then describes how this form of programmed cell death is a process that emerges from the orderly integration of signaling pathways.

S			1.1.5.15.3	DNA sequences program a cell's protein production by being transcribed into RNA and then translated into specific proteins, a process called gene expression.
S			1.16.2.5.3.8	(Staggered ends of a DNA molecule, which often result from double-strand breaks, can trigger signal transduction pathways leading to cell cycle arrest or cell death. )

Q	What is a line of individuals that are identical to each other?
A	"A pure line"
S			4.2342.1.2	A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each "hand" and fingerprints remarkably similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having either "hands" or "paws" on their front limbs.
S			1.24.5.4.1	A biological species is a group of populations whose individuals have the potential to interbreed and produce viable, fertile offspring with each other but not with members of other species.
S			4.2869.1.1	A life cycle is a period involving all different generations of a species succeeding each other through means of reproduction, whether through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction (a period from one generation of organisms to the same identical).
S			4.2867.1.1	A life cycle is a period involving all different generations of a species succeeding each other through means of reproduction, whether through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction (a period from one generation of organisms to the same identical).
S			4.263.1.1	A life cycle of an animal is a period involving all different generations of a species succeeding each other through means of reproduction, whether through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction (a period from one generation of organisms to the same identical).

S			4.251.1.2	Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic (M) phase of the cell cycle the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells, genetically identical to each other and to their parent cell.
S			1.13.3.2.2.3	Therefore, meiosis produces cells that differ genetically from their parent cell and from each other, whereas mitosis produces daughter cells that are genetically identical to their parent cell and to each other.

S			4.861.1.1	Centromere is a region of chromosome where two identical sister chromatids (components of a replicated chromosome) are attached to each other

Q	Who was the first person to being experimenting with traits?
A	"Gregor Mendel"
S			1.1.2.2.4.3	He started with the following three observations from nature: First, individuals in a population vary in their traits, many of which seem to be heritable (passed on from parents to offspring).
S			1.14.1.2.3.7.1	In a testcross, the individual with the unknown genotype is crossed with a homozygous individual expressing the recessive trait (white flowers in this example), and Punnett squares are used to predict the possible outcomes.
S			1.1.2.2.5.2	He reasoned that individuals with inherited traits that are best suited to the local environment are more likely to survive and reproduce than less suited individuals.
S			1.56.1.1.1.1.1	Genetic diversity comprises not only the individual genetic variation within a population, but also the genetic variation between populations that is often associated with adaptations to local conditions (see Chapter 23).
S			1.53.4.4.1	With the important exception of humans, which we will consider later in the chapter, organisms do not choose consciously when to reproduce or how many offspring to have.
S			1.46.3.12.1	Having surveyed some of the general features of animal reproduction, we will focus the rest of the chapter on humans, beginning with the anatomy of the reproductive system in each sex.
S			1.23.0.0.1.2	It is true that natural selection acts on individuals: Each organism's traits affect its survival and reproductive success compared with other individuals.
S			1.22.2.1.2.3.6	Lyell, who was not yet convinced of evolution, nevertheless urged Darwin to publish on the subject before someone else came to the same conclusions and published first.
S			1.34.8.7.6.2	Several fossils discovered in Europe have been interpreted by some researchers as showing a mixture of Neanderthal and human features, leading to the suggestion that European humans bred extensively with or descended from Neanderthals.
S			1.22.2.1.2.2.7	As we'll explore further, his explanation of how adaptations arise centered on natural selection, a process in which individuals that have certain inherited traits tend to survive and reproduce at higher rates than other individuals because of those traits.

Q	What is an individual with mixed traits from two different parents?
A	"A hybrid"
S			1.1.2.2.4.3	He started with the following three observations from nature: First, individuals in a population vary in their traits, many of which seem to be heritable (passed on from parents to offspring).
S			1.1.1.8.1.7	In other words, we can explain traits shared by two organisms with the idea that they have descended from a common ancestor, and we can account for differences with the idea that heritable changes have occurred along the way.
S			4.2396.1.1	A heterozygote is a person possessing two different forms of a particular gene, one inherited from each parent.
S			1.13.3.1.2.4	In contrast, the two chromosomes of a homologous pair are individual chromosomes that were inherited from different parents.
S			1.13.4.1.2.2.3	In fact, this is not the case, because crossing over produces recombinant chromosomes, individual chromosomes that carry genes (DNA) derived from two different parents (Figure 13.11).
S			1.14.1.2.1.5.1	The fourth and final part of Mendel's model, the law of segregation, states that the two alleles for a heritable character segregate (separate from each other) during gamete formation and end up in different gametes.
S			1.14.4.2.1.3.4	From the genotypic ratio, we also can see that out of three offspring with the normal phenotype (one AA plus two Aa), two are predicted to be heterozygous carriers, a 2/3 chance.
S			1.17.1.3.3.6.1	In a research article about alkaptonuria published in 1902, Garrod suggested that humans inherit two "characters" (alleles) for a particular enzyme and that both parents must contribute a faulty version for the offspring to have the disorder.
S			1.14.3.4.3.1	Considering all that can occur in the pathway from genotype to phenotype, it is indeed impressive that Mendel could uncover the fundamental principles governing the transmission of individual genes from parents to offspring.
S			1.15.3.1.1.2	In this case, the characters are body color and wing size, each with two different phenotypes.

Q	What is the term for adults used in an initial cross mating?
A	"The parental generation"
S			1.53.1.1.2.2.6	Mayflies, which survive only a day or two as mating adults, often swarm in great numbers, a behavior that increases their chance of mating.
S			1.24.2.1.2.8.4	All flies used in the mating preference tests were reared for one generation on a standard cornmeal medium.
S			1.46.0.0.3.1	As humans, we tend to think of reproduction in terms of the mating of males and females and the fusion of sperm and eggs.
S			1.23.3.8.5	Nonrandom mating (violation of condition 2) can affect the frequencies of homozygous and heterozygous genotypes but by itself usually has no effect on allele frequencies in the gene pool.
S			1.46.2.2.15.1	Suppose males in the first mating had a mutant allele for the dominant trait of smaller eyes.
S			1.46.2.2.6.3	Studying female fruit flies that copulated with one male and then another, the researchers traced the fate of sperm transferred in the first mating.
S			1.23.2.2.1.3.4	By viewing reproduction as a process of randomly selecting and combining alleles from the bin (the gene pool), we are in effect assuming that mating occurs at random: that is, that all male-female matings are equally likely.
S			1.14.1.2.1.1.5	This figure depicts a pair of homologous chromosomes in an F1 hybrid pea plant.
S			1.14.4.5.1.3.1	When we use Mendel's laws to predict possible outcomes of matings, it is important to remember that each child represents an independent event in the sense that its genotype is unaffected by the genotypes of older siblings.
S			1.14.1.2.1.5.3	In terms of chromosomes, this segregation corresponds to the distribution of the two members of a pair of homologous chromosomes to different gametes in meiosis (see Figure 13.7).

Q	What traits are more prominently displayed as phenotypes?
A	"Dominant traits"
S			1.23.4.1.1.2.2	Thus, selection acts more directly on the phenotype than on the genotype; it acts on the genotype indirectly, via how the genotype affects the phenotype.
S			1.14.3.1.1.1	The inheritance of characters determined by a single gene deviates from simple Mendelian patterns when alleles are not completely dominant or recessive, when a particular gene has more than two alleles, or when a single gene produces multiple phenotypes.
S			1.14.3.2.1.2	We now consider two situations in which two or more genes are involved in determining a particular phenotype.
S			1.51.4.5.2.7	Environment intervenes in the pathway from genotype to phenotype for physical traits and even more so for behavioral traits.
S			4.446.1.1	Balanced polymorphism is the ability of natural selection to maintain a stable proportion of two or more phenotypes in a population
S			1.14.4.14.3	Even more important, it wouldn't be ethical to ask pairs of humans to breed so that the phenotypes of their offspring could be analyzed!
S			4.4759.1.1	Stabilizing selection is a natural selection in which intermediate phenotypes survive or reproduce more successfully than do extreme phenotypes.
S			4.1510.1.1	A disruptive selection is a natural selection in which individuals on both extremes of a phenotypic range survive or reproduce more successfully than do individuals with intermediate phenotypes.
S			4.2167.1.2	A gene with multiple alleles has more than one form, and each form encodes a different version of a trait.
S			1.28.6.16.2	Because support for this hypothesis is based on only one trait: the fusion of the DHFR and TS genes: more data are needed to evaluate its validity.

Q	What traits are less prominently displayed as phenotypes?
A	"Recessive traits"
S			1.14.3.1.1.2.3	This third, intermediate phenotype results from flowers of the heterozygotes having less red pigment than the red homozygotes.
S			1.1.2.2.5.2	He reasoned that individuals with inherited traits that are best suited to the local environment are more likely to survive and reproduce than less suited individuals.
S			1.22.2.2.2.6.3	Even if the advantages of some heritable traits over others are slight, the advantageous variations will gradually accumulate in the population, and less favorable variations will diminish.
S			1.15.1.1.2.9.2	However, no females displayed the white-eye trait; all white-eyed flies were males.
S			1.49.5.4.4.5	There is evidence that changes in tau are associated with the appearance of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, a much less common disorder that affects relatively young individuals.
S			1.13.2.1.8.3	A photograph of the chromosomes is displayed on a computer monitor, and the images of the chromosomes are arranged into pairs according to their appearance.
S			1.21.5.1.1.6	As long as one copy of an essential gene is expressed, the divergence of another copy can lead to its encoded protein acting in a novel way, thereby changing the organism's phenotype.
S			4.1532.1.1	A dominant allele is an allele that is fully expressed in the phenotype of a heterozygote.
S			4.3299.1.1	A phenotype of mutant is an individual bearing an allele that has undergone mutation and is expressed in the phenotype.
S			1.15.2.2.3.1	If an X-linked trait is due to a recessive allele, a female will express the phenotype only if she is homozygous for that allele.

Q	Are recessive traits always masked by dominant traits?
A	"No"
S			1.14.1.2.10.1	The "heritable factor" for the recessive trait (white flowers) had not been destroyed, deleted, or "blended" in the F1 generation but was merely masked by the presence of the factor for purple flowers, which is the dominant trait.
S			1.14.1.2.2.2.1	Because of the different effects of dominant and recessive alleles, an organism's traits do not always reveal its genetic composition.
S			4.2615.1.2	While Mendel's experiments with mixing one trait always resulted in a 3:1 ratio  between dominant and recessive phenotypes, his experiments with mixing two traits (dihybrid cross) showed 9:3:3:1 ratios.
S			1.14.3.1.1.1	The inheritance of characters determined by a single gene deviates from simple Mendelian patterns when alleles are not completely dominant or recessive, when a particular gene has more than two alleles, or when a single gene produces multiple phenotypes.
S			1.14.1.2.1.4.2	Accordingly, Mendel's F1 plants had purple flowers because the allele for that trait is dominant and the allele for white flowers is recessive.
S			1.14.5.14.26	For example, if 1/2 of the offspring have the recessive phenotype and 1/2 the dominant, you know that the cross was between a heterozygote and a homozygous recessive.
S			1.14.3.1.1.7.1	A closer look at the relationship between dominance and phenotype reveals an intriguing fact: For any character, the observed dominant/recessive relationship of alleles depends on the level at which we examine phenotype.
S			1.14.4.3.2.5	Like the presence of extra fingers or toes mentioned earlier, achondroplasia is a trait for which the recessive allele is much more prevalent than the corresponding dominant allele.
S			4.1111.1.4	If AB individuals (heterozygotes) show the same form of the trait (phenotype) as AA individuals (homozygotes), and BB homozygotes show an alternative phenotype, allele A is said to dominate or be dominant to allele B, and B is said to be recessive to A.
S			1.14.1.2.2.4	In Mendel's terminology, purple flower color is a dominant trait, and white flower color is a recessive trait.

Q	What is it called when both traits are dominant?
A	"Co-dominance"
S			1.14.3.1.1.5.2	It is important to understand that an allele is called dominant because it is seen in the phenotype, not because it somehow subdues a recessive allele.
S			1.14.4.1.2.2	This trait, called a widow's peak, is due to a dominant allele, W. Because the widow's-peak allele is dominant, all individuals who lack a widow's peak must be homozygous recessive (ww).
S			1.29.3.1.3.2	This section describes the main traits that characterize living vascular plants: life cycles with dominant sporophytes, transport in vascular tissues called xylem and phloem, and well-developed roots and leaves, including spore-bearing leaves called sporophylls.
S			1.14.4.5.4.7.2	Joan was born with six toes on each foot, a dominant trait called polydactyly.
S			1.14.1.3.13.1	The F1 plants, of genotype YyRr, exhibit both dominant phenotypes, yellow seeds with round shapes, no matter which hypothesis is correct.
S			1.15.3.1.12.1	However, as Figure 15.9 shows, both of the combinations of traits not seen in the P generation (called nonparental phenotypes) were also produced in Morgan's experiments, suggesting that the body-color and wing-size alleles are not always linked genetically.
S			1.14.3.1.1.2.1	For some genes, however, neither allele is completely dominant, and the F1 hybrids have a phenotype somewhere between those of the two parental varieties.
S			4.5485.1.1	A X chromosome phenotype dominant is the phenotype of a female who has one or two dominant alleles for an X chromosome gene or of a male who has the dominant allele for an X chromosome gene.
S			1.14.3.1.1.1	The inheritance of characters determined by a single gene deviates from simple Mendelian patterns when alleles are not completely dominant or recessive, when a particular gene has more than two alleles, or when a single gene produces multiple phenotypes.
S			1.14.3.1.1.4.1	Another variation on dominance relationships between alleles is called codominance; in this variation, the two alleles each affect the phenotype in separate, distinguishable ways.

Q	What determines the traits of offspring?
A	"Hereditary determinants"
S			1.22.2.2.2.5.2	For example, an organism might have a trait that gives its offspring an advantage in escaping predators, obtaining food, or tolerating physical conditions.
S			1.15.3.2.1.1.1	Mendel learned from crosses in which he followed two characters that some offspring have combinations of traits that do not match those of either parent.
S			1.22.2.2.2.5.1	An organism's heritable traits can influence not only its own performance, but also how well its offspring cope with environmental challenges.
S			1.14.4.2.1.3.4	From the genotypic ratio, we also can see that out of three offspring with the normal phenotype (one AA plus two Aa), two are predicted to be heterozygous carriers, a 2/3 chance.
S			1.15.3.2.2.3.3	Fertilization of these various classes of eggs by homozygous recessive sperm (b vg) produced an offspring population in which 17% exhibited a nonparental, recombinant phenotype, reflecting combinations of alleles not seen before in either P generation parent.
S			1.15.3.2.1.2.3	But two nonparental phenotypes are also found among the offspring.
S			4.2191.1.1	A genetic recombination is a general term for the production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either parent.
S			1.15.3.1.12.2	To understand this conclusion, we need to further explore genetic recombination, the production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either parent.
S			4.736.1.2	The heterozygote is phenotypically dominant for the character determined by the gene but can pass on the recessive allele to offspring.
S			1.14.1.2.3.1.4	The allele in the gamete contributed by the mystery plant will therefore determine the appearance of the offspring (Figure 14.7).

Q	Are genes themselves dominant and recessive?
A	"No"
S			4.736.1.2	The heterozygote is phenotypically dominant for the character determined by the gene but can pass on the recessive allele to offspring.
S			1.14.1.2.2.2.1	Because of the different effects of dominant and recessive alleles, an organism's traits do not always reveal its genetic composition.
S			4.4256.1.1	The recessive condition is said to be masked by the presence of the dominant gene when both are present; i. e. , the recessive condition is seen only in the absence of the dominant gene.
S			1.14.5.27.3	Each is controlled by an independently assorting gene and has dominant and recessive expression as follows: Character Dominant Recessive Flower position Axial (A) Terminal (a) Stem length Tall (T) Dwarf (t) Seed shape Round (R) Wrinkled (r)
S			1.14.3.1.1.1	The inheritance of characters determined by a single gene deviates from simple Mendelian patterns when alleles are not completely dominant or recessive, when a particular gene has more than two alleles, or when a single gene produces multiple phenotypes.
S			1.14.3.10.2	For the work that led to his two laws of inheritance, Mendel chose pea plant characters that turn out to have a relatively simple genetic basis: Each character is determined by one gene, for which there are only two alleles, one completely dominant and the other completely recessive.
S			1.14.1.2.10.1	The "heritable factor" for the recessive trait (white flowers) had not been destroyed, deleted, or "blended" in the F1 generation but was merely masked by the presence of the factor for purple flowers, which is the dominant trait.
S			4.4260.1.1	A genetic trait which is is seen only in the absence of the dominant gene.
S			1.15.2.3.8.1	Consider what you learned about dominant and recessive alleles in Concept 14.1.
S			1.14.4.1.3.2	We'll use f for the recessive allele and F for the dominant allele, which results in free earlobes.

Q	What does the principle of segregation theorize?
A	"Each gamete contains one allele type"
S			1.15.6.4.1	The chromosome theory of inheritance states that genes are located on chromosomes and that the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis accounts for Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment.
S			1.15.1.4.4	According to this theory, Mendelian genes have specific loci (positions) along chromosomes, and it is the chromosomes that undergo segregation and independent assortment.
S			4.973.1.1	According to the chromosome theory of inheritance, Mendelian genes have specific loci on chromosomes, and it is the chromosomes that undergo segregation and independent assortment.
S			1.14.3.4.3.4	Furthermore, by extending the principles of segregation and independent assortment to help explain such hereditary patterns as epistasis and quantitative characters, we begin to see how broadly Mendelism applies.
S			1.14.3.10.6	This does not diminish the utility of Mendelian genetics (also called Mendelism), however, because the basic principles of segregation and independent assortment apply even to more complex patterns of inheritance.
S			1.23.2.2.1.1.2	This principle states that the frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a population will remain constant from generation to generation, provided that only Mendelian segregation and recombination of alleles are at work.
S			1.14.1.1.15.7	Mendel's quantitative analysis of the F2 plants from thousands of genetic crosses like these allowed him to deduce two fundamental principles of heredity, which have come to be called the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment.
S			1.15.0.0.1.3	Even after chromosomes were first observed, many biologists remained skeptical about Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment until there was sufficient evidence that these principles of heredity had a physical basis in chromosomal behavior.
S			1.14.2.3.1	Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment reflect the same rules of probability that apply to tossing coins, rolling dice, and drawing cards from a deck.
S			1.14.3.4.3.2	Mendel's two laws, segregation and independent assortment, explain heritable variations in terms of alternative forms of genes (hereditary "particles," now known as the alleles of genes) that are passed along, generation after generation, according to simple rules of probability.

Q	What is an individual with two different alleles called?
A	"Heterozygous for the trait"
S			1.20.2.1.21.1	The band patterns for the three samples are clearly different, so this method can be used to identify heterozygous carriers of the sickle-cell allele (III), as well as those with the disease, who have two mutant alleles (II), and unaffected individuals, who have two normal alleles (I).
S			4.2919.1.5	Diploid and polyploid cells whose chromosomes have the same allele of a given gene at some locus are called homozygous with respect to that gene, while those that have different alleles of a given gene at a locus, heterozygous with respect to that gene.
S			1.14.3.1.1.4.1	Another variation on dominance relationships between alleles is called codominance; in this variation, the two alleles each affect the phenotype in separate, distinguishable ways.
S			1.14.1.2.2.1.4	If we cross dominant homozygotes with recessive homozygotes, every offspring will have two different alleles: Pp in the case of the F1 hybrids of our flower-color experiment (see Figure 14.5).
S			4.2399.1.1	A heterozygous complete dominant is an individual that has two different alleles for the same gene.
S			1.23.1.1.1.2.4	(Recall that a heterozygous individual has two different alleles for a given locus, whereas a homozygous individual has two identical alleles for that locus. )
S			1.14.1.2.1.6.2	For the flower-color character, the model predicts that the two different alleles present in an F1 individual will segregate into gametes such that half the gametes will have the purple-flower allele and half will have the white-flower allele.
S			1.18.5.4.3.6	A woman who inherits one mutant BRCA1 allele has a 60% probability of developing breast cancer before the age of 50, compared with only a 2% probability for an individual homozygous for the normal allele.
S			1.20.2.1.11.4	If one allele contains a RFLP, digestion with the enzyme that recognizes the site will produce a different mixture of fragments for each of the two alleles.
S			1.15.2.4.2	Because the identity of the sex chromosomes in an individual could be inferred by observing the sex of the fly, the behavior of the two members of the pair of sex chromosomes could be correlated with the behavior of the two alleles of the eye-color gene.

Q	What diagram describes possible offspring genotype combinations?
A	"A Punnett square"
S			1.14.2.2.2.4	We can draw a second Punnett square to determine that the same probabilities apply to the offspring genotypes for seed shape: 1/4 RR, 1/2 Rr, and 1/4 rr.
S			1.15.3.2.3.2.2	If the traits conferred by particular combinations of alleles are better suited for a given environment, organisms possessing those genotypes will be expected to thrive and leave more offspring, ensuring the continuation of their genetic complement.
S			1.14.5.12.1	Analysis of family pedigrees can be used to deduce the possible genotypes of individuals and make predictions about future offspring.
S			1.14.2.2.10.3	Assuming independent assortment of the B/b and D/d genes, write the genotypes of all possible offspring from this cross and use the rules of probability to calculate the chance of each genotype occurring.
S			1.23.2.2.1.2.2	Previously, we used Punnett squares to determine the genotypes of offspring in a genetic cross (see Figure 14.5).
S			1.14.3.2.1.2.4	We can use a Punnett square to represent the genotypes of the F2 offspring (Figure 14.12).
S			4.1111.1.3	B), three combinations of alleles (genotypes) are possible: AA, AB, and BB.
S			1.14.1.2.1.6.6	Figure 14.5 illustrates these combinations using a Punnett square, a handy diagrammatic device for predicting the allele composition of offspring from a cross between individuals of known genetic makeup.
S			1.14.4.5.1.3.1	When we use Mendel's laws to predict possible outcomes of matings, it is important to remember that each child represents an independent event in the sense that its genotype is unaffected by the genotypes of older siblings.
S			1.14.3.2.2.1.8	The Punnett square shows all the possible genetic combinations in gametes and in offspring of a large number of hypothetical matings between these heterozygotes.

Q	How are genes expressed?
A	"As specific protein products"
S			1.18.6.26.1	express different genes.
S			1.20.1.7.1	Expressing Cloned Eukaryotic Genes
S			1.16.3.16.3	In other words, genes must also be "expressed.
S			1.17.6.2.5.1	A given type of cell expresses only a subset of its genes.
S			1.20.1.6.1	Screening a Library for Clones Carrying a Gene of Interest
S			1.50.4.2.3.4	Each olfactory receptor cell appears to express one OR gene.
S			1.20.2.3.1.11.6	Each color marks where a specific gene is expressed as mRNA.
S			1.20.5.51.1	It could be used as a probe to detect genes expressed in the brain.
S			1.51.4.1.1.6	Normal male and female flies express distinct forms of the fru gene.
S			1.6.2.1.1.3	All cells contain chromosomes, which carry genes in the form of DNA.

Q	What do genes align on?
A	"Chromosomes"
S			1.13.4.1.2.3.2	Each gene on one homolog is aligned precisely with the corresponding gene on the other homolog.
S			1.18.6.4.3	An operator site on the DNA switches the operon on or off, resulting in coordinate regulation of the genes.
S			1.18.2.3.3.2.2	In these cases, coordinate gene expression depends on the association of a specific combination of control elements with every gene of a dispersed group.
S			1.18.2.3.3.4.3	Coordinate regulation in such pathways is the same as for steroid hormones: Genes with the same control elements are activated by the same chemical signals.
S			1.21.6.2.1.4.5	Proteins with homeodomains probably regulate development by coordinating the transcription of batteries of developmental genes, switching them on or off.
S			1.8.6.24.1	Natural selection, acting on organisms with mutant genes encoding altered enzymes, is a major evolutionary force responsible for the diverse array of enzymes found in organisms.
S			1.21.1.1.1.3	And some human genes had already been located on a particular region of a chromosome by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), a method in which fluorescently labeled nucleic acid probes are allowed to hybridize to an immobilized array of whole chromosomes (see Figure 15.1).
S			1.15.3.3.14.4	Each chromosome has a linear array of specific genes, each gene with its own locus (Figure 15.12).
S			1.15.3.3.14.1	Using recombination data, Sturtevant and his colleagues were able to map numerous Drosophila genes in linear arrays.
S			1.27.6.1.1.6	The genome includes a large array of genes involved in synthesizing carbohydrates, vitamins, and other nutrients needed by humans.

Q	Through what process are chromosomes passed on to gametes?
A	"Meiosis"
S			1.15.2.3.1.6	In the ovaries, Barr-body chromosomes are reactivated in the cells that give rise to eggs, so every female gamete has an active X. Figure 15.8 X inactivation and the tortoiseshell cat.
S			1.13.1.1.3.3	During fertilization, male and female gametes (sperm and eggs) unite, thereby passing on genes of both parents to their offspring.
S			1.21.1.1.1.6	Starting with a cytogenetic map of each chromosome, researchers with the Human Genome Project proceeded through three stages to reach the ultimate goal, the virtually complete nucleotide sequence of every chromosome.
S			1.12.1.2.4.8	Fertilization fuses two gametes together and returns the chromosome number to 46, and mitosis conserves that number in every somatic cell nucleus of the new individual.
S			1.9.6.1.1.4	Glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are catabolic funnels through which electrons from all kinds of organic molecules flow on their exergonic fall to oxygen.
S			1.15.4.1.3.3	Fertilization involving a gamete that has no copy of a particular chromosome will lead to a missing chromosome in the zygote (so that the cell has 2n -' 1 chromosomes); the aneuploid zygote is said to be monosomic for that chromosome.
S			1.16.2.4.2.2	And if they occur in germ cells (which give rise to gametes), mutations can be passed on from generation to generation.
S			1.21.6.2.1.2.5	" The resemblance even extends to the organization of these genes: The vertebrate genes homologous to the homeotic genes of fruit flies have kept the same chromosomal arrangement (Figure 21.18, on the next page).
S			1.28.5.1.4.5	But unlike other algae, they have no flagellated stages in their life cycle and depend on water currents to bring gametes together for fertilization.
S			1.12.3.2.2.1.7	Once activated, the complex sets off a chain of molecular events that activates the enzyme separase, which cleaves the cohesins, allowing the sister chromatids to separate.

Q	Do all gametes have the exact same chromosomal and genetic copies?
A	"No"
S			1.15.4.1.2.3	In these cases, one gamete receives two of the same type of chromosome and another gamete receives no copy.
S			1.21.4.2.1.4	The large segments seem to have been copied from one chromosomal location to another site on the same or a different chromosome and probably include some functional genes.
S			1.15.4.1.3.3	Fertilization involving a gamete that has no copy of a particular chromosome will lead to a missing chromosome in the zygote (so that the cell has 2n -' 1 chromosomes); the aneuploid zygote is said to be monosomic for that chromosome.
S			1.20.1.5.1.4	With automation, PCR can make billions of copies of a target segment of DNA in a few hours, significantly faster than the days it would take to obtain the same number of copies by screening a DNA library for a clone with the desired gene and letting it replicate within host cells.
S			1.21.4.3.2.1	Like the genes of bacteria, many eukaryotic genes are present as unique sequences, with only one copy per haploid set of chromosomes.
S			1.16.2.5.7.2	In the next section, we'll take a step back and examine how DNA is packaged into chromosomes, the structures that carry the genetic information.
S			1.15.6.11.2	When a normal gamete unites with one containing two copies or no copies of a particular chromosome, the resulting zygote and its descendant cells either have one extra copy of that chromosome (trisomy, 2n + 1) or are missing a copy (monosomy, 2n -' 1).
S			1.21.5.4.2.2	By a similar process, a particular exon within a gene could be duplicated on one chromosome and deleted from the other.
S			4.4649.1.2	Sister chromatids contain the same genes and same alleles, and homologous chromosomes contain the same genes but two copies of alleles, each of which might or might not be the same as each other.
S			1.16.2.5.5.2	If the chromosomes of germ cells became shorter in every cell cycle, essential genes would eventually be missing from the gametes they produce.

Q	What is a change in DNA called?
A	"Mutation"
S			1.16.2.4.1.4	As you know, a permanent change in the DNA sequence is called a mutation.
S			1.27.2.2.2.2.1	In a process called conjugation, DNA is transferred between two prokaryotic cells (usually of the same species) that are temporarily joined.
S			1.16.1.1.1.1.7	Griffith called the phenomenon transformation, now defined as a change in genotype and phenotype due to the assimilation of external DNA by a cell.
S			1.13.1.2.2.8	Genetic differences occasionally arise in asexually reproducing organisms as a result of changes in the DNA called mutations, which we will discuss in Chapter 17.
S			1.20.2.1.11.3	Variations in DNA sequence among a population are called polymorphisms (from the Greek for "many forms"), and this particular type of sequence change is called a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP, pronounced "Rif-lip").
S			1.20.1.12.6	To work directly with specific genes, scientists have developed methods for preparing well-defined segments of DNA in multiple identical copies, a process called DNA cloning.
S			1.27.2.2.2.3.5	The DNA replication that accompanies transfer of an F plasmid or part of an Hfr bacterial chromosome is called rolling circle replication.
S			1.6.5.3.1.3	Free ribosomes are present in the stroma, as are copies of chloroplast DNA molecules.
S			1.16.2.2.3.3.2	The DNA strand elongating in this direction is called the lagging strand.
S			1.16.2.1.4.5	In yet a third model, called the dispersive model, all four strands of DNA following replication have a mixture of old and new DNA.

Q	Do males and females have all the same chromosomes?
A	"No"
S			1.15.5.1.5.2	In experiments with mice, for example, embryos engineered to inherit both copies of certain chromosomes from the same parent usually die before birth, whether that parent is male or female.
S			1.15.1.1.2.2.1	Recall that a female fly has two X chromosomes (XX), while a male fly has an X and a Y (XY).
S			1.13.2.1.11.2	Human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes (XX), but males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).
S			1.15.1.1.1.2.3	Female fruit flies have a pair of homologous X chromosomes, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.
S			1.15.2.3.1.1	Female mammals, including humans, inherit two X chromosomes: twice the number inherited by males: so you may wonder whether females make twice as much as males of the proteins encoded by X-linked genes.
S			1.15.2.1.3.4	We can trace the sex of each offspring to the events of conception: If a sperm cell bearing an X chromosome happens to fertilize an egg, the zygote is XX, a female; if a sperm cell containing a Y chromosome fertilizes an egg, the zygote is XY, a male (see Figure 15.6a).
S			4.2479.1.1	Human sex cell have 23 chromosome, the male human sex cell is sperm and the female human sex cell iis ovum.
S			4.5486.1.1	A X chromosome phenotype recessive is the phenotype of a female who has two recessive alleles for an X chromosome gene or of a male who has the recessive allele for an X chromosome gene.
S			4.5485.1.1	A X chromosome phenotype dominant is the phenotype of a female who has one or two dominant alleles for an X chromosome gene or of a male who has the dominant allele for an X chromosome gene.
S			1.15.2.3.2.3	After an X chromosome is inactivated in a particular cell, all mitotic descendants of that cell have the same inactive X. Thus, if a female is heterozygous for a sex-linked trait, about half her cells will express one allele, while the others will express the alternate allele.

Q	Do sex chromosomes carry the same genes?
A	"No"
S			1.15.2.3.2.3	After an X chromosome is inactivated in a particular cell, all mitotic descendants of that cell have the same inactive X. Thus, if a female is heterozygous for a sex-linked trait, about half her cells will express one allele, while the others will express the alternate allele.
S			1.15.1.1.2.15.1	Morgan's finding of the correlation between a particular trait and an individual's sex provided support for the chromosome theory of inheritance: namely, that a specific gene is carried on a specific chromosome (in this case, an eye-color gene on the X chromosome).
S			1.13.2.1.2.5	Both chromosomes of each pair carry genes controlling the same inherited characters.
S			1.13.2.1.11.4	Most of the genes carried on the X chromosome do not have counterparts on the tiny Y, and the Y chromosome has genes lacking on the X. Because they determine an individual's sex, the X and Y chromosomes are called sex chromosomes.
S			1.15.6.6.4	The sex chromosomes carry sex-linked genes for some traits that are unrelated to sex characteristics.
S			4.4587.1.1	A sex-linked inheritance is a inheritance of characteristics that are determined by genes carried on the sex chromosomes.
S			1.13.5.69.2	In a short essay (100-150 words), explain how chromosome behavior during sexual reproduction in animals ensures perpetuation of parental traits in offspring and, at the same time, genetic variation among offspring.
S			1.15.3.7.4	(Note the distinction between the terms sex-linked gene, referring to a single gene on a sex chromosome, and linked genes, referring to two or more genes on the same chromosome that tend to be inherited together. )
S			1.13.1.2.3.3	Genetic variation like that shown in Figure 13.1 is an important consequence of sexual reproduction.
S			4.2396.1.3	For example, a woman who is a heterozygote for cystic fibrosis (CF) carries the CF gene on one of her chromosomes number 7 and the normal paired (non-CF) gene at the same position on her other chromosome 7.

Q	What are the sex chromosomes labeled as?
A	"X and Y"
S			1.15.1.1.2.15.2	In addition, Morgan's work indicated that genes located on a sex chromosome exhibit unique inheritance patterns, which we will discuss in the next section.
S			1.15.5.1.2.4	In each generation, the old imprints are "erased" in gamete-producing cells, and the chromosomes of the developing gametes are newly imprinted according to the sex of the individual forming the gametes.
S			1.15.2.1.1.1	Figure 15.6 Some chromosomal systems of sex determination.
S			1.15.2.1.3.6	Note that the mammalian X-Y system isn't the only chromosomal system for determining sex.
S			1.15.6.6.2	Humans and other mammals have an X-Y system in which sex is determined by whether a Y chromosome is present.
S			4.4585.1.1	A sex-linked gene is a gene located on a sex chromosome.
S			4.4586.1.1	A sex-linked human genetic disorder is a disorder causes by genes on the sex chromosomes.
S			1.15.3.1.1.5	The mutant alleles are recessive to the wild-type alleles, and neither gene is on a sex chromosome.
S			4.4587.1.1	A sex-linked inheritance is a inheritance of characteristics that are determined by genes carried on the sex chromosomes.
S			1.15.1.1.2.21.1	Propose a possible reason that the first naturally occurring mutant fruit fly Morgan saw involved a gene on a sex chromosome.

Q	What is the female sex chromosome composition?
A	"XX"
S			4.2479.1.1	Human sex cell have 23 chromosome, the male human sex cell is sperm and the female human sex cell iis ovum.
S			4.2445.1.1	Homozygous recessive female carries both sex chromosomes having recessive alleles.
S			1.13.5.6.4	The 23rd pair, the sex chromosomes, determines whether the person is female (XX) or male (XY).
S			1.15.2.1.3.4	We can trace the sex of each offspring to the events of conception: If a sperm cell bearing an X chromosome happens to fertilize an egg, the zygote is XX, a female; if a sperm cell containing a Y chromosome fertilizes an egg, the zygote is XY, a male (see Figure 15.6a).
S			1.15.2.3.2.3	After an X chromosome is inactivated in a particular cell, all mitotic descendants of that cell have the same inactive X. Thus, if a female is heterozygous for a sex-linked trait, about half her cells will express one allele, while the others will express the alternate allele.
S			1.15.2.3.1.1	Female mammals, including humans, inherit two X chromosomes: twice the number inherited by males: so you may wonder whether females make twice as much as males of the proteins encoded by X-linked genes.
S			1.15.2.3.1.6	In the ovaries, Barr-body chromosomes are reactivated in the cells that give rise to eggs, so every female gamete has an active X. Figure 15.8 X inactivation and the tortoiseshell cat.
S			1.15.2.3.1.8	Normally, only females can have both alleles, because only they have two X chromosomes.
S			1.15.2.1.2.4	A person who inherits two X chromosomes, one from each parent, usually develops as a female.
S			1.15.2.3.1.2	In fact, most of one X chromosome in each cell in female mammals becomes inactivated during early embryonic development.

Q	What is it called for a gene to be linked to an X or Y chromosome?
A	"Sex-linked genes"
S			1.15.2.2.2.1	While most Y-linked genes help determine sex, the X chromosomes have genes for many characters unrelated to sex.
S			1.15.2.2.4.5	Researchers have traced the disorder to the absence of a key muscle protein called dystrophin and have mapped the gene for this protein to a specific locus on the X chromosome.
S			1.13.2.1.11.4	Most of the genes carried on the X chromosome do not have counterparts on the tiny Y, and the Y chromosome has genes lacking on the X. Because they determine an individual's sex, the X and Y chromosomes are called sex chromosomes.
S			1.15.2.1.6.1	The human X chromosome contains approximately 1,100 genes, which are called X-linked genes.
S			1.15.2.1.5.3	A gene located on either sex chromosome is called a sex-linked gene; those located on the Y chromosome are called Y-linked genes.
S			1.15.6.36.2	Until recently, it was thought that the genes on the Y chromosome might degenerate because they lack homologous genes on the X chromosome with which to recombine.
S			1.15.1.1.2.2.2	The correlation between the trait of white eye color and the male sex of the affected F2 flies suggested to Morgan that the gene involved in his white-eyed mutant was located exclusively on the X chromosome, with no corresponding allele present on the Y chromosome.
S			1.15.2.3.3.6	Multiple copies of the RNA product of this gene apparently attach to the X chromosome on which they are made, eventually almost covering it.
S			1.50.3.2.4.3.2	Because the human genes for the red and green pigments are located on the X chromosome, a single defective copy of either gene can disrupt color vision in males (see Figure 15.7 to review the genetics of sex-linked traits).
S			1.15.2.1.5.5	Because there are so few Y-linked genes, very few disorders are transferred from father to son on the Y chromosome.

Q	What does sex-linked inheritance imply?
A	"That the trait was sex-chromosome linked"
S			1.15.1.1.2.24.1	15.2 Sex-linked genes exhibit unique patterns of inheritance
S			1.15.3.7.4	(Note the distinction between the terms sex-linked gene, referring to a single gene on a sex chromosome, and linked genes, referring to two or more genes on the same chromosome that tend to be inherited together. )
S			1.15.6.46.1	15.2 Sex-linked genes exhibit unique patterns of inheritance
S			1.15.3.1	15.2 Sex-linked genes exhibit unique patterns of inheritance
S			4.4587.1.1	A sex-linked inheritance is a inheritance of characteristics that are determined by genes carried on the sex chromosomes.
S			1.15.6.6.1	15.2 Sex-linked genes exhibit unique patterns of inheritance.
S			1.23.4.3.2.1	Charles Darwin was the first to explore the implications of sexual selection, a form of selection in which individuals with certain inherited characteristics are more likely than other individuals to obtain mates.
S			1.15.2.2.3.2	Because males have only one locus, the terms homozygous and heterozygous lack meaning for describing their X-linked genes; the term hemizygous is used in such cases.
S			1.15.2.3.1.1	Female mammals, including humans, inherit two X chromosomes: twice the number inherited by males: so you may wonder whether females make twice as much as males of the proteins encoded by X-linked genes.
S			1.15.2.2.3.5	However, even though the chance of a female inheriting a double dose of the mutant allele is much less than the probability of a male inheriting a single dose, there are females with X-linked disorders.

Q	What are autosomes?
A	"None-sex chromosomes"
S			4.2989.1.3	It has 2 sex chromosomes and 6 autosomes.
S			1.13.2.1.11.5	The other chromosomes are called autosomes.
S			1.15.1.1.2.14.1	Suppose this eye-color gene were located on an autosome.
S			1.13.5.15.2	A human cell containing 22 autosomes and a Y chromosome is
S			4.419.1.2	The gene for the character is located on one of the autosomes.
S			1.15.2.1.1.2	Numerals indicate the number of autosomes in the species pictured.
S			1.15.1.1.1.2.2	There are three pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes.
S			1.13.2.1.13.4	The set of 23 consists of the 22 autosomes plus a single sex chromosome.
S			1.15.5.1.1.6	(Note that unlike sex-linked genes, most imprinted genes are on autosomes. )
S			4.418.1.1	An autosomal dominant trait is a dominant genetic trait carried on the autosomes.

Q	What causes genes to differ from chromosome to chromosome?
A	"Crossing over"
S			4.4264.1.2	The crossover process leads to recombinant chromosomes having different combinations of genes from their parents.
S			1.21.4.2.1.4	The large segments seem to have been copied from one chromosomal location to another site on the same or a different chromosome and probably include some functional genes.
S			1.17.1.1.1.1.2	They bombarded Neurospora with X-rays, shown in the 1920s to cause genetic changes, and then looked among the survivors for mutants that differed in their nutritional needs from the wild-type bread mold.
S			1.20.4.5.6.2	We can ask how certain genes differ from species to species, as well as how genes and, ultimately, entire genomes have evolved.
S			1.13.4.1.2.2.3	In fact, this is not the case, because crossing over produces recombinant chromosomes, individual chromosomes that carry genes (DNA) derived from two different parents (Figure 13.11).
S			1.15.3.3.13.3	The observed frequency of recombination in crosses involving two such genes can have a maximum value of 50%, a result indistinguishable from that for genes on different chromosomes.
S			1.24.4.1.2.9.2	The chromosomes of individuals from this fifth hybrid generation differed from those in the F1 generation but were similar to those in H. anomalus individuals from natural populations:
S			1.15.2.1.6.2	The fact that males and females inherit a different number of X chromosomes leads to a pattern of inheritance different from that produced by genes located on autosomes.
S			1.23.1.1.2.2.6	However, the patterns of fused chromosomes differ from one population to another.
S			1.15.3.1.12.2	To understand this conclusion, we need to further explore genetic recombination, the production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either parent.

Q	When does crossing over occur?
A	"During meiosis"

Q	Can an offspring phenotype blend aspects of the parental phyenotypes?
A	"Yes"
S			1.14.3.4.3.1	Considering all that can occur in the pathway from genotype to phenotype, it is indeed impressive that Mendel could uncover the fundamental principles governing the transmission of individual genes from parents to offspring.
S			1.14.5.14.25	If, instead, the problem gives you the phenotypic ratios of offspring, but not the genotypes of the parents in a given cross, the phenotypes can help you deduce the parents' unknown genotypes.
S			1.13.1.1.3.1	The transmission of hereditary traits has its molecular basis in the precise replication of DNA, which produces copies of genes that can be passed from parents to offspring.
S			1.14.4.5.3.6.3	If the fetal tests reveal a serious disorder, the parents face the difficult choice of either terminating the pregnancy or preparing to care for a child with a genetic disorder.
S			1.18.4.4.3.1.3	A maternal effect gene is a gene that, when mutant in the mother, results in a mutant phenotype in the offspring, regardless of the offspring's own genotype.
S			1.15.3.2.2.3.3	Fertilization of these various classes of eggs by homozygous recessive sperm (b vg) produced an offspring population in which 17% exhibited a nonparental, recombinant phenotype, reflecting combinations of alleles not seen before in either P generation parent.
S			1.15.3.1.12.2	To understand this conclusion, we need to further explore genetic recombination, the production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either parent.
S			1.14.1.2.3.1.6	But if both the purple and the white phenotypes appear among the offspring, then the purple-flowered parent must be heterozygous.
S			1.15.3.2.1.1.1	Mendel learned from crosses in which he followed two characters that some offspring have combinations of traits that do not match those of either parent.
S			1.15.6.9.1	Among offspring from an F1 testcross, parental types have the same combination of traits as those in the P generation parents.

Q	What is location of a specific gene on a chromosome called?
A	"The locus"
S			1.13.1.1.4.6	A gene's specific location along the length of a chromosome is called the gene's locus (plural, loci; from the Latin, meaning "place").
S			4.2182.1.1	A genetic marker is a gene or DNA sequence with a known location on a chromosome that can be used to identify cells, individual or species.
S			4.2919.1.1	In the fields of genetics and evolutionary computation, a locus (plural loci) is the specific location of a gene or DNA sequence on a chromosome.
S			1.15.2.3.3.5	Then one of the genes, called XIST (for X-inactive specific transcript) becomes active only on the chromosome that will become the Barr body.
S			1.15.2.2.4.5	Researchers have traced the disorder to the absence of a key muscle protein called dystrophin and have mapped the gene for this protein to a specific locus on the X chromosome.
S			1.17.6.2.2.4	We went on to view a gene as a region of specific nucleotide sequence along the length of the DNA molecule of a chromosome (Chapter 16).
S			1.15.1.4.4	According to this theory, Mendelian genes have specific loci (positions) along chromosomes, and it is the chromosomes that undergo segregation and independent assortment.
S			1.21.1.1.1.3	And some human genes had already been located on a particular region of a chromosome by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), a method in which fluorescently labeled nucleic acid probes are allowed to hybridize to an immobilized array of whole chromosomes (see Figure 15.1).
S			1.14.1.2.1.2.5	As noted in Chapter 13, each gene is a sequence of nucleotides at a specific place, or locus, along a particular chromosome.
S			1.12.2.4.3.1	In E. coli, the process of cell division is initiated when the DNA of the bacterial chromosome begins to replicate at a specific place on the chromosome called the origin of replication, producing two origins.

Q	Can only two alleles occur for one gene at a particular locus?
A	"No"
S			1.23.1.1.1.5.4	A difference at only one of these nucleotides can be sufficient to make two alleles of that gene different, increasing gene variability.
S			1.23.5.6.3	For such a population, if p and q represent the frequencies of the only two possible alleles at a particular locus, then p2 is the frequency of one kind of homozygote, q2 is the frequency of the other kind of homozygote, and 2pq is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype.
S			1.23.2.1.3.2	If only one allele exists for a particular locus in a population, that allele is said to be fixed in the gene pool, and all individuals are homozygous for that allele.
S			1.14.3.1.1.4.3	A single gene locus, at which two allelic variations are possible, determines the phenotype of this blood group.
S			1.14.3.4.2.2	Similarly, the term genotype can refer to an organism's entire genetic makeup, not just its alleles for a single genetic locus.
S			1.18.2.3.2.8.4	On average, each enhancer is composed of about ten control elements, each of which can bind only one or two specific transcription factors.
S			1.23.2.2.3.11.2	Suppose a population of organisms with 20,000 gene loci is fixed at half of these loci and has two alleles at each of the other loci.
S			1.14.1.2.1.3.6	The two alleles at a particular locus may be identical, as in the true-breeding plants of Mendel's P generation.
S			1.15.1.5.1	Figure 15.2 shows that the behavior of homologous chromosomes during meiosis can account for the segregation of the alleles at each genetic locus to different gametes.
S			1.14.1.2.1.2.7	The purple-flower allele and the white-flower allele are two DNA sequence variations possible at the flower-color locus on one of a pea plant's chromosomes.

Q	What is the term for more than two alleles at one gene?
A	"Multiple allelism"
S			1.14.3.1.1.1	The inheritance of characters determined by a single gene deviates from simple Mendelian patterns when alleles are not completely dominant or recessive, when a particular gene has more than two alleles, or when a single gene produces multiple phenotypes.
S			1.14.3.1.1.4.3	A single gene locus, at which two allelic variations are possible, determines the phenotype of this blood group.
S			1.14.3.1.2.2.1	Only two alleles exist for the pea characters that Mendel studied, but most genes exist in more than two allelic forms.
S			1.23.2.1.6.4	For loci that have more than two alleles, the sum of all allele frequencies must still equal 1 (100%).
S			4.2167.1.2	A gene with multiple alleles has more than one form, and each form encodes a different version of a trait.
S			1.23.1.1.1.5.4	A difference at only one of these nucleotides can be sufficient to make two alleles of that gene different, increasing gene variability.
S			1.14.3.1.2.2.2	The ABO blood groups in humans, for instance, are determined by three alleles of a single gene: IA, IB, and i. A person's blood group (phenotype) may be one of four types: A, B, AB, or O. These letters refer to two carbohydrates: A and B: that may be found on the surface of red blood cells.
S			1.14.3.4.3.2	Mendel's two laws, segregation and independent assortment, explain heritable variations in terms of alternative forms of genes (hereditary "particles," now known as the alleles of genes) that are passed along, generation after generation, according to simple rules of probability.
S			1.14.3.10.2	For the work that led to his two laws of inheritance, Mendel chose pea plant characters that turn out to have a relatively simple genetic basis: Each character is determined by one gene, for which there are only two alleles, one completely dominant and the other completely recessive.
S			1.14.3.4.2.2	Similarly, the term genotype can refer to an organism's entire genetic makeup, not just its alleles for a single genetic locus.

Q	Do all alleles affect just one single trait?
A	"No"
S			4.1503.1.1	A discrete character is a trait that can be classified on an either-or basis, usually because they are determined by a single gene locus with different alleles that affect distinct phenotypes.
S			1.14.4.2.3.2.1	Although two sickle-cell alleles are necessary for an individual to manifest full-blown sickle-cell disease, the presence of one sickle-cell allele can affect the phenotype.
S			1.14.3.10.2	For the work that led to his two laws of inheritance, Mendel chose pea plant characters that turn out to have a relatively simple genetic basis: Each character is determined by one gene, for which there are only two alleles, one completely dominant and the other completely recessive.
S			1.14.3.1.2.2.2	The ABO blood groups in humans, for instance, are determined by three alleles of a single gene: IA, IB, and i. A person's blood group (phenotype) may be one of four types: A, B, AB, or O. These letters refer to two carbohydrates: A and B: that may be found on the surface of red blood cells.
S			1.14.3.1.3.1.1	So far, we have treated Mendelian inheritance as though each gene affects only one phenotypic character.
S			4.1111.1.1	A complete dominant allele is a dominance in genetics is a relationship between two variant forms (alleles) of a single gene, in which one allele masks the expression of the other in influencing some trait.
S			1.14.3.1.1.1	The inheritance of characters determined by a single gene deviates from simple Mendelian patterns when alleles are not completely dominant or recessive, when a particular gene has more than two alleles, or when a single gene produces multiple phenotypes.
S			1.23.1.1.1.1.3	Many discrete characters are determined by a single gene locus with different alleles that produce distinct phenotypes.
S			1.14.3.1.1.1.6	Segregation of alleles into gametes of the F1 plants results in an F2 generation with a 1:2:1 ratio for both genotype and phenotype.
S			1.14.3.1.1.4.3	A single gene locus, at which two allelic variations are possible, determines the phenotype of this blood group.

Q	What is a gene called that affects a variety of traits?
A	"Pleiotropic"
S			1.23.1.2.1.2.1	A change of as little as one base in a gene, called a "point mutation," can have a significant impact on phenotype, as in sickle-cell disease (see Figure 17.23).
S			1.15.4.7.1	As you have learned so far in this chapter, the phenotype of an organism can be affected by small-scale changes involving individual genes.
S			1.47.0.0.5.5	(Noting that the fly heart fails to develop when this gene is defective, researchers named the Drosophila gene tinman, after the similarly affected character from The Wizard of Oz. )
S			1.14.3.2.1.2.2	Although the two genes affect the same phenotypic character (coat color), they follow the law of independent assortment.
S			1.15.3.1.11.1	The resulting flies had a much higher proportion of the combinations of traits seen in the P generation flies (called parental phenotypes) than would be expected if the two genes assorted independently.
S			1.20.4.4.8.1	Genes conferring useful traits, such as pest resistance, herbicide resistance, delayed ripening, and increased nutritional value, can be transferred from one plant variety or species to another using the Ti plasmid as a vector.
S			1.14.3.1.1.4.1	Another variation on dominance relationships between alleles is called codominance; in this variation, the two alleles each affect the phenotype in separate, distinguishable ways.
S			1.25.5.1.2.1.2	For example, master regulatory genes called homeotic genes (described in Chapters 18 and 21) determine such basic features as where a pair of wings and a pair of legs will develop on a bird or how a plant's flower parts are arranged.
S			1.18.2.2.3.1.2	Inheritance of traits transmitted by mechanisms not directly involving the nucleotide sequence is called epigenetic inheritance.
S			1.18.5.4.2.3	Many of these affect the tumor-suppressor gene called adenomatous polyposis coli, or APC (see Figure 18.25).

Q	Can chromosomes be altered?
A	"Yes"
S			1.15.6.11.4	Chromosome breakage can result in alterations of chromosome structure: deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations.
S			1.15.4.8.2	Physical and chemical disturbances, as well as errors during meiosis, can damage chromosomes in major ways or alter their number in a cell.
S			1.15.6.11.1	15.4 Alterations of chromosome number or structure cause some genetic disorders.
S			1.15.4.8.1	Large-scale chromosomal changes can also affect an organism's phenotype.
S			1.15.6.11.6	Changes in the number of chromosomes per cell or in the structure of individual chromosomes can affect the phenotype and, in some cases, lead to human disorders.
S			1.15.4.2.2.1	Errors in meiosis or damaging agents such as radiation can cause breakage of a chromosome, which can lead to four types of changes in chromosome structure (Figure 15.14).
S			1.21.7.13.1	Accidents in cell division can lead to extra copies of all or part of entire chromosome sets, which may then diverge if one set accumulates sequence changes.
S			1.24.4.1.2.2.4	Unlike the outcome of allopolyploid speciation, in which there is a change in chromosome number after hybridization, in these sunflowers the two parent species and the hybrid all have the same number of chromosomes (2n = 34).
S			1.15.4.3.1.3	Although the frequency of aneuploid zygotes may be quite high in humans, most of these chromosomal alterations are so disastrous to development that the affected embryos are spontaneously aborted long before birth.
S			1.15.4.2.4.4	Nevertheless, translocations and inversions can alter phenotype because a gene's expression can be influenced by its location among neighboring genes; such events sometimes have devastating effects.

S			4.3973.1.1	Polyploidy is a chromosomal alteration in which the organism possesses more than two complete chromosome sets.

Q	What happens if an offspring inherits too many copies of a chromosome?
A	"Genetic disease"
S			1.1.1.6.1.2.1	The DNA of chromosomes replicates as a cell prepares to divide, and each of the two cellular offspring inherits a complete set of genes, identical to that of the parent cell.
S			1.16.3.16.1	In this chapter, you have learned how DNA molecules are arranged in chromosomes and how DNA replication provides the copies of genes that parents pass to offspring.
S			1.15.6.11.2	When a normal gamete unites with one containing two copies or no copies of a particular chromosome, the resulting zygote and its descendant cells either have one extra copy of that chromosome (trisomy, 2n + 1) or are missing a copy (monosomy, 2n -' 1).
S			1.15.5.2.1.5	Organelle genes are not distributed to offspring according to the same rules that direct the distribution of nuclear chromosomes during meiosis, so they do not display Mendelian inheritance.
S			1.15.0.0.2.4	This chapter extends what you learned in the past two chapters: We describe the chromosomal basis for the transmission of genes from parents to offspring, along with some important exceptions to the standard mode of inheritance.

Q	Are viruses considered to be organism?
A	"No"
S			1.26.6.2.3.2	These took place through horizontal gene transfer, a process in which genes are transferred from one genome to another through mechanisms such as exchange of transposable elements and plasmids, viral infection (see Chapter 19), and perhaps fusions of organisms.
S			1.19.0.0.6.2	In addition, the study of viruses has led to the development of techniques that enable scientists to manipulate genes and transfer them from one organism to another.
S			1.19.2.4.5.2	Knowledge about viruses also allows many practical applications, since viruses have a tremendous impact on all organisms through their ability to cause disease.
S			1.35.1.1.3.3.5	It may also confine some pathogens (disease-causing organisms and viruses) that invade the leaf to a single leaflet, rather than allowing them to spread to the entire leaf.
S			4.4946.1.5	For example, some viruses use RNA instead of DNA as their genetic material, and all organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to carry the genetic information that directs the synthesis of proteins.
S			4.2449.1.1	A horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genes from one genome to another through mechanisms such as transposable elements, plasmid exchange, viral activity, and perhaps fusions of different organisms.
S			1.52.4.1.2.1.2	For a transplant to be considered successful, some of the organisms must not only survive in the new area but also reproduce there sustainably.
S			1.38.4.9.6	There are concerns about the unknown risks of releasing GM organisms into the environment, but the potential benefits of transgenic crops need to be considered.
S			1.19.4.53.1	While viruses are considered by most scientists to be nonliving, they do show some characteristics of life, including the correlation of structure and function.
S			1.19.1.1.13.3	Beijerinck imagined a replicating particle much smaller and simpler than a bacterium, and he is generally credited with being the first scientist to voice the concept of a virus.

Q	Can viruses make copies of themselves?
A	"No"
S			1.19.2.3.1.2	Like all viruses, those that cause illness in humans and other animals can replicate only inside host cells.
S			1.19.2.2.2.2.10	A single infected cell can quickly give rise to a large population of bacteria carrying the virus in prophage form.
S			1.19.2.4.3.1	Consistent with this vision of pieces of DNA shuttling from cell to cell is the observation that a viral genome can have more in common with the genome of its host than with the genomes of viruses that infect other hosts.
S			1.20.1.4.2.2.3	Several cultured cell types have proved successful as host cells for this purpose, including some mammalian cell lines and an insect cell line that can be infected by a virus (called baculovirus) carrying recombinant DNA.
S			1.19.2.1.2.8	In contrast, to replicate their genomes, RNA viruses use virally encoded RNA polymerases that can use RNA as a template.
S			1.19.2.3.1.3.4	In the case of herpesviruses, copies of the viral DNA can remain behind as mini-chromosomes in the nuclei of certain nerve cells.
S			1.19.3.3.5.1	Once a virus enters a plant cell and begins replicating, viral genomes and associated proteins can spread throughout the plant by means of plasmodesmata, the cytoplasmic connections that penetrate the walls between adjacent plant cells (see Figure 36.20).
S			1.19.2.2.1.2	Research on phages led to the discovery that some double-stranded DNA viruses can replicate by two alternative mechanisms: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.
S			1.19.4.40.1	host cells lack enzymes that can replicate the viral genome.

Q	What can viruses not manufacture?
A	"ATP"
S			1.19.2.1.2.5	Once the viral genome is inside, the proteins it encodes can commandeer the host, reprogramming the cell to copy the viral nucleic acid and manufacture viral proteins.
S			1.43.4.2.3.1.6	In this form, the viral genome can direct production of new virus particles.
S			1.43.4.2.1.3.4	These changes in the surface proteins of the influenza virus are the reason that a new flu vaccine must be manufactured and distributed each year.
S			1.19.3.1.1.1	A viral infection can produce symptoms by a number of different routes.
S			1.43.3.3.2.5.2	When a virus uses a cell's biosynthetic machinery to produce viral proteins, these viral products can appear on the cell surface.
S			1.19.4.48.2	Such a virus evades the host's defenses by mutating and producing many altered progeny viruses before the body can mount an attack.
S			1.19.3.2.4.1	A second process that can lead to the emergence of viral diseases is the dissemination of a viral disease from a small, isolated human population.

S			1.43.4.2.3.1.6	In this form, the viral genome can direct production of new virus particles.
S			1.19.2.3.1.3.5	There they remain latent until some sort of physical or emotional stress triggers a new round of active virus production.
S			1.5.4.2.3.6	A technique called X-ray crystallography was used to generate a computer model of an antibody protein (blue and orange, left) bound to a flu virus protein (green and yellow, right).
S			4.3748.1.1	A phage reproduction cycle is the propagation cycle of phage viruses, which exists in two forms: lysogenic and lytic.
S			1.43.4.2.3.4.2	Unfortunately, mutations that occur in each round of viral reproduction can generate strains of HIV that are drug resistant.
S			1.19.2.4.2.3	Because they depend on cells for their own propagation, it seems likely that viruses are not the descendants of precellular forms of life but evolved: possibly multiple times: after the first cells appeared.
S			1.19.2.1.3.1	After the viral nucleic acid molecules and capsomeres are produced, they spontaneously self-assemble into new viruses.
S			1.19.0.0.2.3	By injecting its DNA into the cell, the virus sets in motion a genetic takeover of the bacterium, recruiting cellular machinery to mass-produce many new viruses.
S			1.16.1.1.2.16.1	Hershey and Chase concluded that the DNA injected by the phage must be the molecule carrying the genetic information that makes the cells produce new viral DNA and proteins.

Q	Can viruses have affects on individuals outside of cells?
A	"No"
S			4.2336.1.1	A human t cell leukemia virus is a retrovirus, which causes a type of leukemia affecting T cells.
S			1.19.2.3.1.2	Like all viruses, those that cause illness in humans and other animals can replicate only inside host cells.
S			1.43.5.12.8	Immune defense against cancer appears to primarily involve action against viruses that can cause cancer, as well as against cancer cells that harbor viruses.
S			1.43.4.2.1.3.6	When this occurs, influenza can take on such a radically different appearance that none of the memory cells in the human population recognize the new strain.
S			1.23.1.2.1.2.1	A change of as little as one base in a gene, called a "point mutation," can have a significant impact on phenotype, as in sickle-cell disease (see Figure 17.23).

S			1.18.5.4.5.2	In addition to the mutations and other genetic alterations described in this section, a number of tumor viruses can cause cancer in various animals, including humans.
S			1.18.3.1.4.3	Because the cellular RNAi pathway can lead to the destruction of RNAs with sequences complementary to those found in double-stranded RNAs, this pathway may have evolved as a natural defense against infection by such viruses.
S			1.7.1.4.8.4	An absence of CCR5 on the cells of resistant individuals, due to the gene alteration, prevents the virus from entering the cells (below, right).

Q	Are viruses found along a tree of life?
A	"No"
S			1.19.2.4.4.9	The question of whether some viruses deserve their own early branch on the tree of life may not be answered for some time.
S			1.28.1.6.2	The large, multicellular organisms that we know best (plants, animals, and fungi) are the tips of just a few branches on the great tree of life (see Figure 26.21).
S			1.19.2.4.2.2	Viruses have been found that infect every form of life: not just bacteria, animals, and plants, but also archaea, fungi, and algae and other protists.
S			1.19.0.0.4.3	" Because viruses are capable of causing a wide variety of diseases and can be spread between organisms, researchers in the late 1800s saw a parallel with bacteria and proposed that viruses were the simplest of living forms.
S			1.19.2.4.2.3	Because they depend on cells for their own propagation, it seems likely that viruses are not the descendants of precellular forms of life but evolved: possibly multiple times: after the first cells appeared.
S			4.5426.1.1	A virus is on the verge of the living and nonnliving world.
S			1.2.0.0.2.2	Colorful birds, insects, and other animals live in a densely-packed environment of trees, shrubs, vines, and wildflowers, and an excursion along a waterway or a forest path typically reveals a lush variety of plant life.
S			1.19.2.2.1.2	Research on phages led to the discovery that some double-stranded DNA viruses can replicate by two alternative mechanisms: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.
S			1.27.4.1.4.4	As we saw in Chapter 26, such gene transfers can make it difficult to determine the root of the tree of life.
S			1.26.6.3.3.1	Although scientists continue to debate whether early steps in the history of life are best represented as a tree, a ring, or a tangled web, in recent decades there have been many exciting discoveries about evolutionary events that occurred later in time.

Q	Can viruses infect bacteria?
A	"Yes"
S			1.19.2.2.2.2.10	A single infected cell can quickly give rise to a large population of bacteria carrying the virus in prophage form.
S			1.19.4.6.3	Phages (viruses that infect bacteria) can replicate by two alternative mechanisms: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.

S			1.19.3.1.3.5	Most antiviral drugs resemble nucleosides and as a result interfere with viral nucleic acid synthesis.
S			1.19.1.2.1.1.3	A virus is called a DNA virus or an RNA virus, based on the kind of nucleic acid that makes up its genome.
S			4.2199.1.1	A viral genome is the complete complement of a virus's genes along with its noncoding nucleic acid sequences.

Q	How does HIV work?
A	"It attacks specific cell types"
S			1.26.5.2.1.7	HIV's genetic material is made of RNA, and like other RNA viruses, it evolves quickly.
S			1.19.2.3.2.2.8	For simplicity, the cell-surface proteins that act as receptors for HIV are not shown.
S			1.19.3.2.1.2	HIV, the AIDS virus, is a classic example: This virus appeared in San Francisco in the early 1980s, seemingly out of nowhere, although later studies uncovered a case in the Belgian Congo in 1959.
S			1.7.1.4.8.3	Further work showed that HIV binds to a main protein receptor (CD4) on an immune cell, but most types of HIV also need to bind to CCR5 as a "co-receptor" to actually infect the cell (below, left).
S			1.23.1.2.3.1.6	For this reason, it is unlikely that a single-drug treatment would ever be effective against HIV; mutant forms of the virus that are resistant to a particular drug would no doubt proliferate in relatively short order.
S			1.19.3.1.3.8	In the past two decades, much effort has gone into developing drugs against HIV.

A	"Cells of the immune system"
S			1.7.1.4.8.3	Further work showed that HIV binds to a main protein receptor (CD4) on an immune cell, but most types of HIV also need to bind to CCR5 as a "co-receptor" to actually infect the cell (below, left).

S			1.12.1.3.2	In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, most cell division involves the distribution of identical genetic material: DNA: to two daughter cells.
S			1.11.5.1.2.3	These and most other proteins involved in apoptosis are continually present in cells, but in inactive form; thus, regulation occurs at the level of protein activity rather than through gene activity and protein synthesis.
S			1.6.3.3.1	On the first stop of our detailed tour of the cell, let's look at two cellular components involved in the genetic control of the cell: the nucleus, which houses most of the cell's DNA, and the ribosomes, which use information from the DNA to make proteins.
S			1.20.4.1.2.3.5	Two factors may have contributed to the development of leukemia: the insertion of the retroviral vector near a gene involved in the proliferation of blood cells and an unknown function of the replacement gene itself.

Q	Do infected cells eventually die?
A	"Yes"
S			1.11.5.3.3	Cells that are infected, damaged, or have reached the end of their functional life span often undergo "programmed cell death.
S			1.19.2.1.3.3	The simplest type of viral replicative cycle ends with the exit of hundreds or thousands of viruses from the infected host cell, a process that often damages or destroys the cell.
S			1.19.2.2.1.2.2	The term refers to the last stage of infection, during which the bacterium lyses (breaks open) and releases the phages that were produced within the cell.
S			1.43.3.2.1.6	An activated cytotoxic T cell releases molecules that make pores in an infected cell's membrane and enzymes that break down proteins, promoting the cell's death.
S			1.43.3.3.2.5.1	Although antibodies are the cornerstone of the response in body fluids, there is also a mechanism by which they can bring about the death of infected body cells.
S			1.19.2.1.3.5	The viral progeny that exit a cell have the potential to infect additional cells, spreading the viral infection.
S			4.2545.1.1	A hypersensitive response is a plant's localized defense response to a pathogen, involving the death of cells around the site of infection.
S			1.19.2.1.3.4	Such cellular damage and death, as well as the body's responses to this destruction, cause many of the symptoms associated with viral infections.
S			1.43.3.2.3.2	The death of the infected cell not only deprives the pathogen of a place to reproduce, but also exposes cell contents to circulating antibodies, which mark them for disposal.
S			1.19.3.1.1.7	Many of the temporary symptoms associated with viral infections, such as fever and aches, actually result from the body's own efforts at defending itself against infection rather than from cell death caused by the virus.

Q	How are viruses stopped?
A	"Many vaccines eliminate certain viruses"
S			1.19.1.2.2.3.4	They also contain proteins and glycoproteins of viral origin.
S			4.2946.1.2	Lymph nodes filter lymph and contain cells that attack viruses and bacteria.

Q	Why is a new flu vaccine required each year?
A	"Viruses mutate and immunity is lost"
S			1.43.4.2.1.3.4	These changes in the surface proteins of the influenza virus are the reason that a new flu vaccine must be manufactured and distributed each year.
S			1.17.1.1.1.3.3	Mutants in each class required a different set of compounds along the arginine-synthesizing pathway, which has three steps.
S			1.35.4.1.15.5	Because each new layer of secondary xylem has a larger circumference, secondary growth enables the xylem to transport more sap each year, supplying an increasing number of leaves.
S			1.27.4.1.3.5	Each year these techniques add new branches to the tree of life.
S			1.51.2.2.5.4.4	Between breeding seasons, the song becomes flexible again, and an adult male may learn new song "syllables" each year, adding to the song it already sings.
S			1.22.3.1.2.11.5	Researchers responded by developing antibiotics that were not destroyed by penicillinase, but some S. aureus populations developed resistance to each new drug within a few years.
S			1.53.1.2.3.4.2	Squirrels, for example, have a litter of two to six young once a year for less than a decade, whereas oak trees drop thousands of acorns each year for tens or hundreds of years.

Q	What do antiviral drugs do?
A	"They prevent viruses from replicating"

S			1.22.3.1.2.12.4	However, S. aureus populations exhibited variations in how strongly their members were affected by the drug.
S			1.22.3.1.2.14.3	A drug does not create resistant pathogens; it selects for resistant individuals that are already present in the population.
S			1.22.3.1.2.7.3	Ongoing studies of how MRSA strains colonize their hosts and cause disease may help scientists develop drugs to combat MRSA.

Q	How large is a nanometer (nm)?

S			4.1634.1.1	The entire spectrum of electromagnetic radiation ranging in wavelength from less than a nanometer to more than a kilometer.
S			1.15.3.3.15.2	The frequency of crossing over is not actually uniform over the length of a chromosome, as Sturtevant assumed, and therefore map units do not correspond to actual physical distances (in nanometers, for instance).
S			1.10.2.1.2.2	Wavelengths range from less than a nanometer (for gamma rays) to more than a kilometer (for radio waves).
S			1.6.1.1.3.6	Similarly, using standard techniques, the light microscope cannot resolve detail finer than about 0.2 micrometer (microm), or 200 nanometers (nm), regardless of the magnification (Figure 6.2).

S			1.42.1.3.1.2.2	The blood passes through the heart once in each complete circuit, an arrangement called single circulation (Figure 42.4a).
S			1.42.8.4.4	Vertebrates have a closed circulatory system, in which blood circulates in a closed network of pumps and vessels.
S			1.42.1.2.1.3.2	Circulatory systems are either open or closed, vary with regard to the number of circuits in the body, and rely on pumps that differ in structure and organization.

A	"Capillary beds"
S			1.42.1.3.2.3.1	After the oxygen-enriched blood leaves the gas exchange tissues, it enters the other pump, the left side of the heart.
S			1.42.1.9.6	The second solution, found in all other animals, is a circulatory system that moves fluid between each cell's immediate surroundings and the tissues where exchange with the environment occurs.
S			1.42.1.1.3.1	In animals with a gastrovascular cavity, fluid bathes both the inner and outer tissue layers, facilitating exchange of gases and cellular waste.
S			1.42.1.3.2.4.3	This contrasts sharply with single circulation, in which blood flows under reduced pressure directly from the gas exchange organs to other organs.
S			1.42.1.3.2.2.1	One pump, the right side of the heart, delivers oxygen-poor blood to the capillary beds of the gas exchange tissues, where there is a net movement of O2 into the blood and of CO2 out of the blood.
S			1.42.1.3.2.7	Across the thin walls of capillaries, chemicals, including dissolved gases, are exchanged by diffusion between the blood and the interstitial fluid around the tissue cells.
S			1.33.1.4.2	Because both cell layers are in contact with water, processes such as gas exchange and waste removal can occur by diffusion across the membranes of these cells.

S			1.42.5.4.4.1	The arrangement of capillaries in a fish gill allows for countercurrent exchange, the exchange of a substance or heat between two fluids flowing in opposite directions.
S			1.42.3.2.3.2	The exchange of substances between the blood and interstitial fluid occurs only in capillaries because only capillaries have walls thin enough to permit this transfer.
S			4.695.1.1	A capillary is a microscopic blood vessel that penetrates the tissues and consists of a single layer of endothelial cells that allows exchange between the blood and interstitial fluid.
S			1.42.2.1.2.9	Then branches lead to  capillary beds in the head and arms (forelimbs).

S			1.42.2.1.2.10	The aorta then descends into the abdomen, supplying oxygen-rich blood to arteries leading to  capillary beds in the abdominal organs and legs (hind limbs).
S			1.42.3.4.2.5	The other mechanism for altering flow, shown in Figure 42.14, involves the action of precapillary sphincters, rings of smooth muscle located at the entrance to capillary beds.

Q	What happens when an aorta recoils?
A	"The blood is expelled quickly"
S			1.42.8.72.1	Plot blood pressure against time for one cardiac cycle in humans, drawing separate lines for the pressure in the aorta, the left ventricle, and the right ventricle.
S			1.42.3.2.2.5	The result is a dramatic decrease in velocity from the arteries to the capillaries: Blood travels 500 times slower in the capillaries (about 0.1 cm/sec) than in the aorta (about 48 cm/sec).
S			1.42.6.4.6.2	However, when the O2 level drops very low (at high altitudes, for instance), O2 sensors in the aorta and the carotid arteries in the neck send signals to the breathing control centers, which respond by increasing the breathing rate.
S			1.42.2.1.2.7	Blood leaves the left ventricle via  the aorta, which conveys blood to arteries leading throughout the body.
S			1.42.3.2.1.8	Blood pressure, the main force driving blood from the heart to the capillaries, is highest in the aorta and other arteries.
S			1.42.2.2.5.8	When the ventricles relax, blood pressure built up in the aorta closes the semilunar valves and prevents significant backflow.
S			1.42.2.1.2.8	The first branches leading from the aorta are the coronary arteries (not shown), which supply blood to the heart muscle itself.
S			1.42.8.15.10	Secondary control over breathing is exerted by sensors in the aorta and carotid arteries that monitor blood levels of O2 as well as CO2 (via blood pH).

Q	What must remain uniform in a thermodynamic system for a Gibbs free energy measurement to be meaningful?
A	"Pressure and temperature."
S			4.4747.1.1	A spontaneous change is the time-evolution of a system in which it releases free energy (most often as heat) and moves to a lower, more thermodynamically stable, energy state.
S			1.8.2.1.1.2	" In 1878, J. Willard Gibbs, a professor at Yale, defined a very useful function called the Gibbs free energy of a system (without considering its surroundings), symbolized by the letter G. We'll refer to the Gibbs free energy simply as free energy.
S			1.8.2.1.1.3	Free energy is the portion of a system's energy that can perform work when temperature and pressure are uniform throughout the system, as in a living cell.
S			1.8.4.2.1.1	Proteins, DNA, and other complex molecules of the cell are rich in free energy and have the potential to decompose spontaneously; that is, the laws of thermodynamics favor their breakdown.
S			1.8.2.2.4.1	We can think of free energy as a measure of a system's instability: its tendency to change to a more stable state.
S			4.2056.1.1	Free energy is the energy in a physical system that can be converted to do work.
S			1.8.2.2.3.2	Because it has less free energy, the system in its final state is less likely to change and is therefore more stable than it was previously.
S			1.8.2.2.3.4	Unstable systems (top) are rich in free energy, G. They have a tendency to change spontaneously to a more stable state (bottom), and it is possible to harness this "downhill" change to perform work.

Q	What does a negative deltaG value indicate about a given process?
A	"The process will be spontaneous."
S			1.8.2.1.5.2	More than a century of experiments has shown that only processes with a negative deltaG are spontaneous.
S			1.8.2.1.5.3	For deltaG to be negative, either deltaH must be negative (the system gives up enthalpy and H decreases) or TdeltaS must be positive (the system gives up order and S increases), or both: When deltaH and TdeltaS are tallied, deltaG has a negative value (deltaG &lt; 0) for all spontaneous processes.
S			1.9.1.1.8.2	Recall that a negative deltaG indicates that the products of the chemical process store less energy than the reactants and that the reaction can happen spontaneously: in other words, without an input of energy.
S			1.8.4.4.3.1	Most metabolic reactions are reversible, and an enzyme can catalyze either the forward or the reverse reaction, depending on which direction has a negative deltaG.
S			1.8.2.2.3.1	Thus, deltaG can be negative only when the process involves a loss of free energy during the change from initial state to final state.
S			1.12.3.3.7.1	Over the past several decades, researchers have produced a flood of valuable information about cell-signaling pathways and how their malfunction contributes to the development of cancer through effects on the cell cycle.
S			1.8.2.2.1.1	As we saw in the previous section, when a process occurs spontaneously in a system, we can be sure that deltaG is negative.
S			1.16.2.2.2.3	What scientists have learned about eukaryotic DNA replication suggests, however, that most of the process is fundamentally similar for prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
S			1.28.3.1.2.4.4	Furthermore, researchers have now tracked the expression of most of the parasite's genes at numerous points in its life cycle.
S			1.8.4.10.1	The laws of thermodynamics tell us what will and will not happen under given conditions but say nothing about the rate of these processes.

Q	What happens to the energy released during a spontaneous process?
A	"It enters the surroundings."
S			1.8.2.2.3.1	Thus, deltaG can be negative only when the process involves a loss of free energy during the change from initial state to final state.
S			1.8.6.10.2	The change in free energy (deltaG) during a biological process is related directly to enthalpy change (deltaH) and to the change in entropy (deltaS): deltaG = deltaH - TdeltaS.
S			1.8.3.2.1.5	Instead, the cell's proteins harness the energy released during ATP hydrolysis in several ways to perform the three types of cellular work: chemical, transport, and mechanical.
S			1.8.2.2.3.4	Unstable systems (top) are rich in free energy, G. They have a tendency to change spontaneously to a more stable state (bottom), and it is possible to harness this "downhill" change to perform work.
S			1.9.3.2.2.4	The cycle generates 1 ATP per turn by substrate-level phosphorylation, but most of the chemical energy is transferred to NAD+ and a related electron carrier, the coenzyme FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide, derived from riboflavin, a B vitamin), during the redox reactions.
S			1.8.2.2.3.3	Figure 8.5 The relationship of free energy to stability, work capacity, and spontaneous change.
S			1.8.1.3.2.1.2	It turns out that during every energy transfer or transformation, some energy becomes unavailable to do work.
S			1.8.6.10.4	During a spontaneous change, free energy decreases and the stability of a system increases.
S			1.8.2.1.5.4	In other words, every spontaneous process decreases the system's free energy, and processes that have a positive or zero deltaG are never spontaneous.
S			1.8.2.1.5.1	Once we know the value of deltaG for a process, we can use it to predict whether the process will be spontaneous (that is, whether it is energetically favorable and will occur without an input of energy).

Q	How does free energy and a system's likelihood to change related?

Q	What keeps carbon dioxide and water from spontaneously assembling into glucose and oxygen?
A	"Entropy favors CO2 and H2O."
S			1.8.2.3.2.3.8	The overall sequence of reactions is kept going by the huge free-energy difference between glucose and oxygen at the top of the energy "hill" and carbon dioxide and water at the "downhill" end.
S			1.8.2.3.1.8.6	If deltaG = -'686 kcal/mol for respiration, which converts glucose and oxygen to carbon dioxide and water, then the reverse process: the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to glucose and oxygen: must be strongly endergonic, with deltaG = +686 kcal/mol.
S			1.8.1.1.3.4	A major pathway of catabolism is cellular respiration, in which the sugar glucose and other organic fuels are broken down in the presence of oxygen to carbon dioxide and water.
S			4.1214.1.2	For example, blood in a fish gill flows in the opposite direction of water passing over the gill, maximizing diffusion of oxygen into and carbon dioxide out of the blood.
S			1.10.1.2.1.2	Although some of the steps are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 1800s: In the presence of light, the green parts of plants produce organic compounds and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water.

Q	Do exergonic reactions treat energy as a reactant or a product?
A	"A product."

S			1.8.4.1.2.2	We can think of activation energy as the amount of energy needed to push the reactants to the top of an energy barrier, or uphill, so that the "downhill" part of the reaction can begin.

Q	Do endergonic reactions treat energy as a reactant or a product?
A	"A reactant."
S			1.8.6.15.1	Through energy coupling, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis drives endergonic reactions by transfer of a phosphate group to specific reactants, forming a phosphorylated intermediate that is more reactive.
S			1.9.1.1.8.2	Recall that a negative deltaG indicates that the products of the chemical process store less energy than the reactants and that the reaction can happen spontaneously: in other words, without an input of energy.
S			1.8.2.3.1.6.1	For each mole (180 g) of glucose broken down by respiration under what are called "standard conditions" (1 M of each reactant and product, 25 degree C, pH 7), 686 kcal (2,870 kJ) of energy are made available for work.
S			1.8.3.5.1	A key feature in the way cells manage their energy resources to do this work is energy coupling, the use of an exergonic process to drive an endergonic one.

S			1.8.3.1.5.2	The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, as "high-energy" may imply; rather, the reactants (ATP and water) themselves have high energy relative to the energy of the products (ADP and &#9413;i).

Q	Does a catabolic endergonic process make sense?
A	"No."
S			1.8.3.3.4.2	Catabolic (exergonic) pathways, especially cellular respiration, provide the energy for the endergonic process of making ATP.
S			1.8.6.15.1	Through energy coupling, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis drives endergonic reactions by transfer of a phosphate group to specific reactants, forming a phosphorylated intermediate that is more reactive.
S			1.8.3.5.1	A key feature in the way cells manage their energy resources to do this work is energy coupling, the use of an exergonic process to drive an endergonic one.
S			4.1942.1.1	Fermentation is a catabolic process that makes a limited amount of ATP from glucose without an electron transport chain and that produces a characteristic end product, such as ethyl alcohol or lactic acid.
S			1.10.3.1.2	However, while the citric acid cycle is catabolic, oxidizing acetyl CoA and using the energy to synthesize ATP, the Calvin cycle is anabolic, building carbohydrates from smaller molecules and consuming energy.
S			1.8.3.3.4.4	Thus, the ATP cycle is a revolving door through which energy passes during its transfer from catabolic to anabolic pathways.

S			1.8.3.3.4.2	Catabolic (exergonic) pathways, especially cellular respiration, provide the energy for the endergonic process of making ATP.
S			4.15.1.8	Furthermore, ATP needs to be stored; the cycle undergoes an exergonic reaction, or a reaction that produces energy, called dephosphorylation.
S			1.8.6.15.1	Through energy coupling, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis drives endergonic reactions by transfer of a phosphate group to specific reactants, forming a phosphorylated intermediate that is more reactive.

Q	Why is it misleading to think of molecular bonds as "storing" energy?
A	"Breaking these bonds consumes energy."
S			1.9.0.0.2.8	In this chapter, we consider how cells harvest the chemical energy stored in organic molecules and use it to generate ATP, the molecule that drives most cellular work.
S			1.8.2.3.1.6.3	The products are, in a sense, the spent exhaust of a process that tapped the free energy stored in the bonds of the sugar molecules.
S			4.2110.1.2	This molecule stores energy in the covalent bonds between phosphate groups.
S			1.9.1.2.2.3.1	In general, organic molecules that have an abundance of hydrogen are excellent fuels because their bonds are a source of "hilltop" electrons, whose energy may be released as these electrons "fall" down an energy gradient when they are transferred to oxygen.
S			1.8.4.1.2.6	When the molecules have absorbed enough energy for the bonds to break, the reactants are in an unstable condition known as the transition state.
S			1.8.4.1.1.6	To reach the contorted state where bonds can change, reactant molecules must absorb energy from their surroundings.
S			1.8.4.1.1.7	When the new bonds of the product molecules form, energy is released as heat, and the molecules return to stable shapes with lower energy than the contorted state.
S			1.8.4.1.2.1	The initial investment of energy for starting a reaction: the energy required to contort the reactant molecules so the bonds can break: is known as the free energy of activation, or activation energy, abbreviated EA in this book.
S			1.41.5.4.3.4	Individuals with genes promoting the storage of high-energy molecules during feasts may have been more likely to survive famines.
S			1.10.0.0.1.2	The chloroplasts of plants capture light energy that has traveled 150 million kilometers from the sun and convert it to chemical energy that is stored in sugar and other organic molecules.

Q	Where does the energy from "breaking bonds" come from?
A	"The formation of new bonds."
S			1.8.3.1.5.3	The release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a state of lower free energy, not from the phosphate bonds themselves.
S			1.8.4.4.4.4	Because EA is proportional to the difficulty of breaking the bonds, distorting the substrate helps it approach the transition state and thus reduces the amount of free energy that must be absorbed to achieve that state.
S			1.3.2.3.2.6	As the temperature falls from 4 degree C to 0 degree C, water begins to freeze because more and more of its molecules are moving too slowly to break hydrogen bonds.
S			1.12.3.2.2.4.4	Follow-up studies revealed that the binding of a cell-surface protein to its counterpart on an adjoining cell sends a growth-inhibiting signal to both cells, preventing them from moving forward in the cell cycle, even in the presence of growth factors.
S			1.36.5.3.3	The flow of water and minerals from soil to roots to leaves is largely in a direction opposite to the direction necessary for transporting sugars from mature leaves to lower parts of the plant, such as root tips that require large amounts of sugars for energy and growth.
S			1.9.4.1.6.2	Instead, it eases the fall of electrons from food to oxygen, breaking a large free-energy drop into a series of smaller steps that release energy in manageable amounts.
S			1.9.4.1.1.8	The overall energy drop (deltaG) for electrons traveling from NADH to oxygen is 53 kcal/mol, but this "fall" is broken up into a series of smaller steps by the electron transport chain.
S			1.16.2.2.1.3.4	After the parental strands separate, single-strand binding proteins bind to the unpaired DNA strands, keeping them from re-pairing.
S			1.8.4.1.2.6	When the molecules have absorbed enough energy for the bonds to break, the reactants are in an unstable condition known as the transition state.
S			1.8.4.1.4.2	At the summit, when energy equivalent to EA has been absorbed, the reactants are in the transition state: They are activated, and their bonds can be broken.

Q	If deltaG of the oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide is -686 kcal/mol, what is deltaG of the reverse reaction, the reduction of carbon dioxide to glucose?
A	"deltaG = +686 kcal/mol."
S			1.8.2.3.1.8.6	If deltaG = -'686 kcal/mol for respiration, which converts glucose and oxygen to carbon dioxide and water, then the reverse process: the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to glucose and oxygen: must be strongly endergonic, with deltaG = +686 kcal/mol.
S			1.9.4.3.6.2	Recall that the complete oxidation of a mole of glucose releases 686 kcal of energy under standard conditions (deltaG = -'686 kcal/mol).
S			1.9.1.1.8.1	This breakdown of glucose is exergonic, having a free-energy change of -'686 kcal (2,870 kJ) per mole of glucose decomposed (deltaG = -'686 kcal/mol).
S			1.8.4.10.3	For example, even though the hydrolysis of sucrose (table sugar) to glucose and fructose is exergonic, occurring spontaneously with a release of free energy (deltaG = -7 kcal/mol), a solution of sucrose dissolved in sterile water will sit for years at room temperature with no appreciable hydrolysis.
S			1.9.1.3.7.1	For each molecule of glucose degraded to carbon dioxide and water by respiration, the cell makes up to about 32 molecules of ATP, each with 7.3 kcal/mol of free energy.
S			1.9.1.3.7.2	Respiration cashes in the large denomination of energy banked in a single molecule of glucose (686 kcal/mol) for the small change of many molecules of ATP, which is more practical for the cell to spend on its work.
S			1.8.2.3.1.6.1	For each mole (180 g) of glucose broken down by respiration under what are called "standard conditions" (1 M of each reactant and product, 25 degree C, pH 7), 686 kcal (2,870 kJ) of energy are made available for work.
S			1.8.2.3.1.9.2	Plants get the required energy: 686 kcal to make a mole of glucose: from the environment by capturing light and converting its energy to chemical energy.
S			1.9.4.1.1.8	The overall energy drop (deltaG) for electrons traveling from NADH to oxygen is 53 kcal/mol, but this "fall" is broken up into a series of smaller steps by the electron transport chain.
S			1.9.1.2.2.4.4	If we supply the activation energy by igniting glucose, it burns in air, releasing 686 kcal (2,870 kJ) of heat per mole of glucose (about 180 g).

Q	In general, when can the forward and back reactions of a given process occur at the same time?
A	"When deltaG is zero."
S			1.22.4.4.2	In contrast to catastrophism (the principle that events in the past occurred suddenly by mechanisms not operating today), Hutton and Lyell thought that geologic change results from mechanisms that operated in the past in the same manner as at the present time (uniformitarianism).
S			1.20.1.3.2.7.6	Finally, by making cDNA from cells of the same type at different times in the life of an organism, researchers can trace changes in patterns of gene expression during development.
S			1.6.6.2.1.6.3	In contrast, cilia work more like oars, with alternating power and recovery strokes generating force in a direction perpendicular to the cilium's axis, much as the oars of a racing crew boat extend outward at a right angle to the boat's forward movement.
S			4.4993.1.1	The tail is the section at the rear end of an animal's body; in general, the term refers to a distinct, flexible appendage to the torso.
S			1.25.5.2.1.1.2	But since other genetic changes also may have occurred at such times, it can be difficult to establish causal links between genetic and morphological changes that occurred in the past.
S			1.12.3.2.3.3	Animal cells generally have built-in stop signals that halt the cell cycle at checkpoints until overridden by go-ahead signals.
S			1.50.3.1.3.1.6	Similar to a camera's focusing action, muscles in an invertebrate's single-lens eye move the lens forward or backward, focusing on objects at different distances.
S			1.21.6.2.2.2.2	For example, work on the small flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that establishing the radial pattern of flower parts, like setting up the head-to-tail axis in Drosophila, involves a cascade of transcription factors (see Chapter 35).
S			1.6.7.3.2.7.1	The polypeptide chain that makes up a tight junction weaves back and forth through the membrane four times, with two extracellular loops, and one loop plus short C-terminal and N-terminal tails in the cytoplasm.
S			1.20.3.3.7.1	Resolving the debate now seems less imperative because researchers have been able to turn back the clock in fully differentiated cells, reprogramming them to act like ES cells.

Q	What happens to a cell that arrives at metabolic equilibrium?
A	"It dies."
S			1.8.2.3.2.2.3	Because systems at equilibrium are at a minimum of G and can do no work, a cell that has reached metabolic equilibrium is dead!
S			1.8.2.3.2.3.2	The constant flow of materials in and out of the cell keeps the metabolic pathways from ever reaching equilibrium, and the cell continues to do work throughout its life.
S			1.8.2.3.2.3.9	As long as our cells have a steady supply of glucose or other fuels and oxygen and are able to expel waste products to the surroundings, their metabolic pathways never reach equilibrium and can continue to do the work of life.
S			1.13.2.2.2.5	This type of cell division reduces the number of sets of chromosomes from two to one in the gametes, counterbalancing the doubling that occurs at fertilization.
S			1.8.2.3.2.4.4	Now that we have applied the free-energy concept to metabolism, we are ready to see how a cell actually performs the work of life.
S			1.18.2.1.4.3	In all organisms, a common control point for gene expression is at transcription; regulation at this stage often occurs in response to signals coming from outside the cell, such as hormones or other signaling molecules.
S			1.48.4.4.5.2.3	In many of its targets, including smooth muscle cells, NO works like many hormones, stimulating an enzyme to synthesize a second messenger that directly affects cellular metabolism.
S			1.18.1.1.2.2	When an E. coli cell must make tryptophan for itself because the nutrient medium lacks this amino acid, all the enzymes for the metabolic pathway are synthesized at one time.
S			1.8.2.3.2.2.4	The fact that metabolism as a whole is never at equilibrium is one of the defining features of life.
S			1.44.1.2.4.2.2	Land animals maintain water balance by drinking and eating moist foods and by producing water metabolically through cellular respiration.

Q	Why doesn't the deltaG of ATP hydrolysis in the cell agree with the deltaG measured at standard conditions?
A	"Cellular conditions are not standard."	"Cellular ATP/ADP concentrations aren't 1M."
S			1.9.4.3.6.5	Thus, about 34% of the potential chemical energy in glucose has been transferred to ATP; the actual percentage is probably higher because deltaG is lower under cellular conditions.
S			1.8.4.10.3	For example, even though the hydrolysis of sucrose (table sugar) to glucose and fructose is exergonic, occurring spontaneously with a release of free energy (deltaG = -7 kcal/mol), a solution of sucrose dissolved in sterile water will sit for years at room temperature with no appreciable hydrolysis.
S			1.8.6.15.2	ATP hydrolysis (sometimes with protein phosphorylation) also causes changes in the shape and binding affinities of transport and motor proteins.
S			1.9.1.3.5.4	The energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion (or prokaryotic cell) can use to make ATP from ADP.
S			1.41.2.1.2.1.1	In most animal species, at least some hydrolysis occurs by extracellular digestion, the breakdown of food in compartments that are continuous with the outside of the animal's body.
S			1.21.2.3.1.2.4	The researchers reasoned that if the observed fitness matched the prediction, then the products of the two genes didn't interact with each other, but if the observed fitness was greater or less than predicted, then the gene products interacted in the cell.
S			1.8.3.2.2.1	For example, with the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis directly to drive chemical reactions that, by themselves, are endergonic.
S			1.48.2.1.1.5	As discussed in Chapter 7, these ion pumps use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to actively transport Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell (Figure 48.7).
S			1.8.3.2.1.5	Instead, the cell's proteins harness the energy released during ATP hydrolysis in several ways to perform the three types of cellular work: chemical, transport, and mechanical.
S			1.8.3.2.1.7	In this example, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis is used to drive an endergonic process: the cellular synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia.

Q	What is another function of ATP aside from its use in energy coupling?
A	"It can incorporate into RNA."
S			1.12.2.2.18.3	During anaphase, the region of overlap is reduced as motor proteins attached to the microtubules walk them away from one another, using energy from ATP.
S			1.9.4.2.1.9	This process, in which energy stored in the form of a hydrogen ion gradient across a membrane is used to drive cellular work such as the synthesis of ATP, is called chemiosmosis (from the Greek osmos, push).
S			1.10.2.7.1.10	In other words, mitochondria use chemiosmosis to transfer chemical energy from food molecules to ATP, whereas chloroplasts transform light energy into chemical energy in ATP.
S			1.8.3.1.2.3	In addition to its role in energy coupling, ATP is also one of the nucleoside triphosphates used to make RNA (see Figure 5.26).
S			1.9.1.3.5.4	The energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion (or prokaryotic cell) can use to make ATP from ADP.

S			1.10.5.18.1	The Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma, using electrons from NADPH and energy from ATP.

Q	Why can't ATP be incorporated into DNA?
A	"Hydroxyl group on ribose 2-carbon."
S			1.10.4.3.1.7	During the day, when the light reactions can supply ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle, CO2 is released from the organic acids made the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts.
S			1.27.2.2.1.2.3	Once inside the cell, the foreign DNA can be incorporated into the genome by homologous DNA exchange.
S			1.13.4.2.4.6	Evidence suggests that this DNA can become incorporated into the genome of the rotifer, leading to increased genetic diversity.
S			1.27.2.2.1.1.2	For example, a harmless strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae can be transformed into pneumonia-causing cells if the cells are placed in a medium containing DNA from a pathogenic strain (see p. 306).
S			4.1759.1.1	Episomes are plasmids that can integrate themselves into the chromosomal DNA of the host organism.
S			1.18.5.4.6.2	However, we now know that viruses can interfere with gene regulation in several ways if they integrate their genetic material into the DNA of a cell.
S			1.19.4.7.2	Retroviruses (such as HIV) use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to copy their RNA genome into DNA, which can be integrated into the host genome as a provirus.
S			1.19.2.2.2.1.6	After entering the bacterial cell and circularizing, the ' DNA can immediately initiate the production of a large number of progeny phages (lytic cycle) or integrate into the bacterial chromosome (lysogenic cycle).
S			1.16.2.2.2.3.4	Like ATP, the nucleoside triphosphates used for DNA synthesis are chemically reactive, partly because their triphosphate tails have an unstable cluster of negative charge.
S			1.16.1.1.2.4.3	Because protein, but not DNA, contains sulfur, radioactive sulfur atoms were incorporated only into the protein of the phage.

Q	What happens when ATP is hydrolyzed in a test tube?

S			1.9.4.2.1.3	Recall from Chapter 7 that ion pumps usually use ATP as an energy source to transport ions against their gradients.
S			1.7.6.10.1	Specific membrane proteins use energy, usually in the form of ATP, to do the work of active transport.

Q	What does ATP hydrolysis mean?
A	"Removing a phosphate with water."
S			1.8.3.1.5.1	Because their hydrolysis releases energy, the phosphate bonds of ATP are sometimes referred to as high-energy phosphate bonds, but the term is misleading.
S			1.8.5.1.1.3.2	The products of ATP hydrolysis (ADP and Pi), for example, play a complex role in balancing the flow of traffic between anabolic and catabolic pathways by their effects on key enzymes.

A	"Reaction coupling results in spontaneity."
S			4.3989.1.1	Population dynamics is a field of biology where the developmental processes of different organisms are compared in order to determine ancestry between them and also to determine the evolution of processes.
S			1.8.1.3.2.5.9	This understanding gives us another way to state the second law: For a process to occur spontaneously, it must increase the entropy of the universe.
S			1.8.1.3.2.5.5	Some spontaneous processes, such as an explosion, may be virtually instantaneous, while others, such as the rusting of an old car over time, are much slower.
S			1.8.2.1.5.3	For deltaG to be negative, either deltaH must be negative (the system gives up enthalpy and H decreases) or TdeltaS must be positive (the system gives up order and S increases), or both: When deltaH and TdeltaS are tallied, deltaG has a negative value (deltaG &lt; 0) for all spontaneous processes.
S			1.8.2.2.3.4	Unstable systems (top) are rich in free energy, G. They have a tendency to change spontaneously to a more stable state (bottom), and it is possible to harness this "downhill" change to perform work.
S			1.39.3.3.4.4	Deviation of the free-running period from exactly 24 hours does not mean that biological clocks drift erratically.
S			1.8.2.1.5.1	Once we know the value of deltaG for a process, we can use it to predict whether the process will be spontaneous (that is, whether it is energetically favorable and will occur without an input of energy).
S			1.8.1.3.3.2.4	At the organismal level as well, complex and beautifully ordered structures result from biological processes that use simpler starting materials (Figure 8.4).
S			1.4.3.2.2.4	Although ATP is sometimes said to store energy, it is more accurate to think of it as storing the potential to react with water.
S			4.3562.1.1	A maturation of organism is the process of an individual organism growing organically; a purely biological unfolding of events involved in an organism changing gradually from a simple to a more complex level is called as organism maturation.

Q	How does a cell harness the energy from ATP hydrolysis?
A	"Phosphorylation produces high energy molecules."
S			1.8.3.2.1.5	Instead, the cell's proteins harness the energy released during ATP hydrolysis in several ways to perform the three types of cellular work: chemical, transport, and mechanical.
S			1.48.2.1.1.5	As discussed in Chapter 7, these ion pumps use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to actively transport Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell (Figure 48.7).
S			1.8.3.2.2.1	For example, with the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis directly to drive chemical reactions that, by themselves, are endergonic.
S			1.8.3.2.1.7	In this example, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis is used to drive an endergonic process: the cellular synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia.
S			1.8.3.1.5.3	The release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a state of lower free energy, not from the phosphate bonds themselves.
S			1.41.1.11.2	This energy is used to produce ATP, which powers processes ranging from DNA replication and cell division to vision and flight.
S			1.9.1.3.5.4	The energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion (or prokaryotic cell) can use to make ATP from ADP.
S			1.9.1.2.3.7.2	Later in this chapter, you will learn more about how the cell uses the energy released from this exergonic electron fall to regenerate its supply of ATP.
S			4.3607.1.1	An oxidative phosphorylation is the production of ATP using energy derived from the redox reactions of an electron transport chain; the third major stage of cellular respiration.
S			1.6.5.5.3	Mitochondria (singular, mitochondrion) are the sites of cellular respiration, the metabolic process that uses oxygen to generate ATP by extracting energy from sugars, fats, and other fuels.

Q	How much ATP does a human turn over in a day?
A	"Nearly their body weight."
S			1.8.3.3.2.7	If ATP could not be regenerated by the phosphorylation of ADP, humans would use up nearly their body weight in ATP each day.
S			1.15.5.2.3.3	Defects in one or more of these proteins, therefore, reduce the amount of ATP the cell can make and have been shown to cause a number of rare human disorders.
S			1.9.4.3.3.4	We know that 1 NADH results in 10 H+ being transported out across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but the exact number of H+ that must reenter the mitochondrial matrix via ATP synthase to generate 1 ATP has long been debated.
S			1.10.4.3.1.7	During the day, when the light reactions can supply ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle, CO2 is released from the organic acids made the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts.
S			4.914.1.1	Chemiosmosis is an energy-coupling mechanism that uses energy stored in the form of a hydrogen ion gradient across a membrane to drive cellular work, such as the synthesis of ATP.
S			4.1810.1.1	An eukaryotic chemiosmosis is an energy-coupling mechanism that uses energy stored in the form of a hydrogen ion gradient across a membrane to drive cellular work, such as the synthesis of ATP.
S			1.9.4.2.1.9	This process, in which energy stored in the form of a hydrogen ion gradient across a membrane is used to drive cellular work such as the synthesis of ATP, is called chemiosmosis (from the Greek osmos, push).
S			1.24.4.1.2.11.1	Over time, the chromosomes in the population of experimental hybrids became similar to the chromosomes of H. anomalus individuals from natural populations.
S			4.1651.1.2	These H+ ions are used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main energy intermediate in living organisms, as they move back across the membrane.
S			4.1650.1.2	These H+ ions are used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main energy intermediate in living organisms, as they move back across the membrane.

Q	How is ATP regeneration an anabolic process?
A	"Energy is spent making ATP."
S			1.8.3.3.4.4	Thus, the ATP cycle is a revolving door through which energy passes during its transfer from catabolic to anabolic pathways.
S			4.216.1.1	An anabolic pathway is the series of chemical reactions that constructs or synthesizes molecules from smaller units, usually requiring input of energy (ATP) in the process.
S			1.9.6.3.3.9	If citrate consumption increases, either because of a demand for more ATP or because anabolic pathways are draining off intermediates of the citric acid cycle, glycolysis accelerates and meets the demand.
S			1.10.3.1.2	However, while the citric acid cycle is catabolic, oxidizing acetyl CoA and using the energy to synthesize ATP, the Calvin cycle is anabolic, building carbohydrates from smaller molecules and consuming energy.
S			1.10.3.1.9	The light reactions sustain the Calvin cycle by regenerating ATP and NADPH.
S			1.8.3.3.3.1	Because both directions of a reversible process cannot be downhill, the regeneration of ATP from ADP and &#9413;i is necessarily endergonic: ADP + &#9413;i &rarr; ATP +  H2O &Delta;G = +7.3 kcal/mol (+30.5 kJ/mol) (standard conditions)
S			1.9.1.1.9.3	To keep working, the cell must regenerate its supply of ATP from ADP andi (see Figure 8.11).
S			1.9.6.3.3.4	The enzyme becomes active again as cellular work converts ATP to ADP (and AMP) faster than ATP is being regenerated.
S			1.8.3.3.2.1	An organism at work uses ATP continuously, but ATP is a renewable resource that can be regenerated by the addition of phosphate to ADP (Figure 8.11).
S			1.9.6.2.1.10	Of course, these anabolic, or biosynthetic, pathways do not generate ATP, but instead consume it.

Q	What does the deltaG value for a given process tell you about its rate of reaction?
A	"Nothing."
S			1.8.2.1.5.3	For deltaG to be negative, either deltaH must be negative (the system gives up enthalpy and H decreases) or TdeltaS must be positive (the system gives up order and S increases), or both: When deltaH and TdeltaS are tallied, deltaG has a negative value (deltaG &lt; 0) for all spontaneous processes.
S			1.8.4.10.1	The laws of thermodynamics tell us what will and will not happen under given conditions but say nothing about the rate of these processes.
S			1.8.2.1.5.1	Once we know the value of deltaG for a process, we can use it to predict whether the process will be spontaneous (that is, whether it is energetically favorable and will occur without an input of energy).
S			1.40.3.3.2.6.2	By allowing blood to pass through the heat exchanger or diverting it to other blood vessels, these animals alter the rate of heat loss as their physiological state or environment changes.
S			1.17.5.2.1.8	Rough estimates have been made of the rate of mutation during DNA replication for both E. coli and eukaryotes, and the numbers are similar: About one nucleotide in every 1010 is altered, and the change is passed on to the next generation of cells.
S			1.26.5.1.1.1.4	But if most of the rest are neutral and have little or no effect on fitness, then the rate of molecular change should indeed be regular, like a clock.
S			1.21.5.2.4.3	The rate of these events seems to have accelerated about 100 million years ago, around the time large dinosaurs became extinct and the number of mammalian species increased rapidly.
S			1.8.4.4.3.1	Most metabolic reactions are reversible, and an enzyme can catalyze either the forward or the reverse reaction, depending on which direction has a negative deltaG.
S			1.3.3.7.1	As indicated by the double arrows, this is a reversible reaction that reaches a state of dynamic equilibrium when water molecules dissociate at the same rate that they are being re-formed from H+ and OH-'.
S			1.8.2.2.3.1	Thus, deltaG can be negative only when the process involves a loss of free energy during the change from initial state to final state.

Q	What is the correlation between the "height" of an activation barrier and the rate of the reaction it governs?
A	"Higher barriers means less reaction."
S			1.8.4.1.5.2	However, the activation energy provides a barrier that determines the rate of the reaction.
S			1.8.4.1.2.10	However, the activation energy (EA) provides a barrier that determines the rate of the reaction.
S			1.8.4.1.2.2	We can think of activation energy as the amount of energy needed to push the reactants to the top of an energy barrier, or uphill, so that the "downhill" part of the reaction can begin.
S			1.8.4.1.5.3	The reactants must absorb enough energy to reach the top of the activation energy barrier before the reaction can occur.
S			1.11.4.2.2.3.5	In cell B, a pathway that is triggered by a single kind of signal diverges to produce two responses; such branched pathways often involve receptor tyrosine kinases (which can activate multiple relay proteins) or second messengers (which can regulate numerous proteins).
S			4.1607.1.1	An egg activation is a sharp rise in the animal egg's metabolic rate in response to the cortical reaction.
S			1.43.0.0.5.2	Binding of an innate immune receptor to a foreign molecule activates internal defenses, enabling responses to a very broad range of pathogens.
S			1.24.3.2.3.4.2	But whether our predictions are upheld or not, events in hybrid zones can shed light on how barriers to reproduction between closely related species change over time.
S			1.40.2.2.1.1.2	Regulating room temperature depends on a control center (a thermostat) that detects temperature change and activates mechanisms that reverse that change.
S			1.11.4.2.2.3.7	Branching of pathways and "cross-talk" (interaction) between pathways are important in regulating and coordinating a cell's responses to information coming in from different sources in the body.

Q	How do enzymes interact with activation barriers?
A	"They lower them."
S			1.9.1.2.2.4.6	Instead, if you swallow some glucose, enzymes in your cells will lower the barrier of activation energy, allowing the sugar to be oxidized in a series of steps.
S			1.11.4.1.3.4	The final step in the signaling pathway that begins with epinephrine binding activates the enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen.
S			4.1106.1.3	The inhibitor may interact with the enzyme at the active site, but no reaction takes place.
S			4.3425.1.3	The net effect of a non competitive inhibitor is to change the shape of the enzyme and thus the active site, so that the substrate can no longer interact with the enzyme to give a reaction.
S			1.11.1.3.2.5	First, epinephrine does not interact directly with the enzyme responsible for glycogen breakdown; an intermediate step or series of steps must be occurring inside the cell.
S			1.8.3.3.8.3	For suggested answers, see Appendix A. Chapter 8 continues with 8.4 Enzymes speed up metabolic reactions by lowering energy barriers
S			1.11.2.3.8	For many receptors, this shape change directly activates the receptor, enabling it to interact with other cellular molecules.
S			4.2876.1.2	Ligand binding generally causes a receptor protein to undergo a change in shape which for many receptors activates the receptor enabling it to interact with other cellular molecules.
S			1.39.1.7.14	As discussed in Chapter 11, a hormone or other kind of stimulus interacting with a specific receptor protein can trigger the sequential activation of relay proteins and also the production of second messengers that participate in the pathway.
S			1.8.4.2.1.9	Without affecting the free-energy change (deltaG) for a reaction, an enzyme speeds the reaction by reducing its activation energy (EA).

Q	How does the existence of activation barriers for spontaneous processes agree with the second law of thermodynamics?
A	NIL
S			1.8.6.7.2	The second law of thermodynamics states that spontaneous processes, those requiring no outside input of energy, increase the entropy (disorder) of the universe.
S			1.8.1.3.2.5.9	This understanding gives us another way to state the second law: For a process to occur spontaneously, it must increase the entropy of the universe.
S			1.55.1.1.2.1	One implication of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that every exchange of energy increases the entropy of the universe, is that energy conversions are inefficient; some energy is always lost as heat (see Chapter 8).
S			1.8.4.1.2.9	Thermodynamically, this is an exergonic reaction, with a negative deltaG, and the reaction occurs spontaneously.
S			1.8.1.3.2.3.4	We can now state the second law of thermodynamics: Every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe.
S			1.8.6.8.1	Explain how the highly ordered structure of a cell does not conflict with the second law of thermodynamics.
S			1.9.1.2.2.4.2	Only the barrier of activation energy holds back the flood of electrons to a lower energy state (see Figure 8.12).
S			1.8.1.3.1.1.1	According to the first law of thermodynamics, the energy of the universe is constant: Energy can be transferred and transformed, but it cannot be created or destroyed.
S			1.8.4.2.1.1	Proteins, DNA, and other complex molecules of the cell are rich in free energy and have the potential to decompose spontaneously; that is, the laws of thermodynamics favor their breakdown.
S			1.8.4.10.1	The laws of thermodynamics tell us what will and will not happen under given conditions but say nothing about the rate of these processes.

Q	How can a cell supply a molecule with activation energy?
A	"Heat"	"Phosphorylation."
S			1.8.4.2.1.2	These molecules persist only because at temperatures typical for cells, few molecules can make it over the hump of activation energy.
S			1.10.4.4.3.2	The sugar made in the chloroplasts supplies the entire plant with chemical energy and carbon skeletons for the synthesis of all the major organic molecules of plant cells.
S			1.9.5.2.2.8	Thus, cellular respiration harvests much more energy from each sugar molecule than fermentation can.
S			1.11.3.3.1.2.4	When epinephrine outside the cell binds to a specific receptor protein, the protein activates adenylyl cyclase, which in turn can catalyze the synthesis of many molecules of cAMP.
S			1.43.3.2.2.2	As with helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells have an accessory protein that binds to the MHC molecule, helping keep the two cells in contact while the T cell is activated.
S			4.2876.1.2	Ligand binding generally causes a receptor protein to undergo a change in shape which for many receptors activates the receptor enabling it to interact with other cellular molecules.
S			1.43.2.2.4.6	If the cell displaying an antigen fragment encounters a T cell with the right specificity, the antigen receptor on the T cell can bind to both the antigen fragment and the MHC molecule.
S			1.27.3.4.2	Like all organisms, prokaryotes can be categorized by how they obtain energy and the carbon used in building the organic molecules that make up cells.
S			1.9.1.3.7.1	For each molecule of glucose degraded to carbon dioxide and water by respiration, the cell makes up to about 32 molecules of ATP, each with 7.3 kcal/mol of free energy.
S			1.11.2.3.8	For many receptors, this shape change directly activates the receptor, enabling it to interact with other cellular molecules.

Q	Where does the released energy of an exergonic reaction come from?
A	"Formation of new low-energy bonds."
S			1.8.3.3.2.2	The free energy required to phosphorylate ADP comes from exergonic breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell.
S			1.9.1.2.3.7.2	Later in this chapter, you will learn more about how the cell uses the energy released from this exergonic electron fall to regenerate its supply of ATP.
S			4.1719.1.1	An energy-coupling is a in cellular metabolism, the use of energy released from an exergonic reaction to drive an endergonic reaction.
S			1.9.1.2.3.6.1	Electron transfer from NADH to oxygen is an exergonic reaction with a free-energy change of -'53 kcal/mol (-'222 kJ/mol).
S			1.8.3.2.2.2	If the deltaG of an endergonic reaction is less than the amount of energy released by ATP hydrolysis, then the two reactions can be coupled so that, overall, the coupled reactions are exergonic (Figure 8.9).
S			1.9.4.2.5.2	In mitochondria, the energy for gradient formation comes from exergonic redox reactions, and ATP synthesis is the work performed.
S			1.8.3.1.5.3	The release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a state of lower free energy, not from the phosphate bonds themselves.
S			4.1857.1.1	An exergonic reaction is a spontaneous chemical reaction, in which there is a net release of free energy.
S			1.8.2.3.1.2.2	An exergonic reaction proceeds with a net release of free energy (Figure 8.6a).
S			1.8.3.1.3.3	The reaction is exergonic and releases 7.3 kcal of energy per mole of ATP hydrolyzed: ATP + H2O &rarr; ADP + &#9413;i &Delta;G = -'7.3 kcal/mol (-'30.5 kJ/mol)

Q	Why are negative activation barrier heights not observed?
A	"Molecules wouldn't leave transition state."
S			1.8.4.1.5.3	The reactants must absorb enough energy to reach the top of the activation energy barrier before the reaction can occur.
S			1.8.4.1.2.2	We can think of activation energy as the amount of energy needed to push the reactants to the top of an energy barrier, or uphill, so that the "downhill" part of the reaction can begin.
S			1.9.1.2.2.4.2	Only the barrier of activation energy holds back the flood of electrons to a lower energy state (see Figure 8.12).
S			1.9.1.2.2.4.6	Instead, if you swallow some glucose, enzymes in your cells will lower the barrier of activation energy, allowing the sugar to be oxidized in a series of steps.
S			1.39.2.2.7.5.2	The fact that this mutation activates the ethylene response suggests that the normal kinase product of the wild-type allele is a negative regulator of ethylene signal transduction.
S			1.8.4.1.4.2	At the summit, when energy equivalent to EA has been absorbed, the reactants are in the transition state: They are activated, and their bonds can be broken.
S			1.8.4.1.1	The Activation Energy Barrier
S			1.8.4.1.5.2	However, the activation energy provides a barrier that determines the rate of the reaction.
S			1.8.4.1.2.10	However, the activation energy (EA) provides a barrier that determines the rate of the reaction.
S			1.12.3.2.2.4	However, just as a washer's cycle is subject to both internal control (such as the sensor that detects when the tub is filled with water) and external adjustment (such as activation of the start mechanism), the cell cycle is regulated at certain checkpoints by both internal and external signals.

Q	How does an enzyme affect the height of an activation barrier?
A	"It lowers the barrier."
S			1.8.4.2.1.9	Without affecting the free-energy change (deltaG) for a reaction, an enzyme speeds the reaction by reducing its activation energy (EA).
S			1.9.1.2.2.4.6	Instead, if you swallow some glucose, enzymes in your cells will lower the barrier of activation energy, allowing the sugar to be oxidized in a series of steps.
S			1.8.4.1.5.3	The reactants must absorb enough energy to reach the top of the activation energy barrier before the reaction can occur.
S			1.8.4.1.2.2	We can think of activation energy as the amount of energy needed to push the reactants to the top of an energy barrier, or uphill, so that the "downhill" part of the reaction can begin.
S			1.11.5.2.2.3	When a death-signaling ligand occupies a cell-surface receptor, this binding leads to activation of caspases and other enzymes that carry out apoptosis, without involving the mitochondrial pathway.
S			1.45.1.5.3.7	Rather than activate protein kinase A, the alpha receptor triggers a distinct signaling pathway involving a different G protein and different enzymes.
S			1.8.4.2.1.8	Figure 8.13 The effect of an enzyme on activation energy.
S			1.8.4.4.4.1	Enzymes use a variety of mechanisms that lower activation energy and speed up a reaction (see Figure 8.15, step &#10114;).
S			1.8.5.1.1.3.9	ATP, ADP, and other related molecules also affect key enzymes in anabolic pathways.
S			1.8.4.5.1.2.2	Up to a point, the rate of an enzymatic reaction increases with increasing temperature, partly because substrates collide with active sites more frequently when the molecules move rapidly.

Q	How does an enzyme affect the deltaG of a reaction?
A	"It doesn't."
S			1.8.4.2.1.9	Without affecting the free-energy change (deltaG) for a reaction, an enzyme speeds the reaction by reducing its activation energy (EA).
S			1.9.4.2.1.5	As we mentioned in Chapter 8, enzymes can catalyze a reaction in either direction, depending on the deltaG for the reaction, which is affected by the local concentrations of reactants and products.
S			1.8.4.4.3.1	Most metabolic reactions are reversible, and an enzyme can catalyze either the forward or the reverse reaction, depending on which direction has a negative deltaG.
S			1.8.4.2.2.2	An enzyme cannot change the deltaG for a reaction; it cannot make an endergonic reaction exergonic.
S			1.8.2.2.3.1	Thus, deltaG can be negative only when the process involves a loss of free energy during the change from initial state to final state.
S			1.11.4.1.3.3	As we have seen, the response of liver cells to the hormone epinephrine helps regulate cellular energy metabolism by affecting the activity of an enzyme.
S			4.1745.1.1	An enzyme-substrate complex is the complex formed during a chemical reaction (involving only one substrate), when the substrate molecule binds to the active site of the particular enzyme, is an enzyme substrate complex.
S			1.39.1.3.1.2	In most cases, these responses involve the increased activity of particular enzymes.
S			1.11.6.10.2	In other pathways, the response involves cytoplasmic regulation, including cytoskeletal rearrangement (which can lead to cell shape changes) or changes in enzyme activity.
S			1.8.4.5.1.2.2	Up to a point, the rate of an enzymatic reaction increases with increasing temperature, partly because substrates collide with active sites more frequently when the molecules move rapidly.

Q	How can an enzyme make a nonspontaneous reaction spontaneous?
A	"It can't."
S			1.8.4.4.7.2	However, there is a limit to how fast the reaction can be pushed by adding more substrate to a fixed concentration of enzyme.
S			1.8.4.2.2.3	Enzymes can only hasten reactions that would eventually occur anyway, but this function makes it possible for the cell to have a dynamic metabolism, routing chemicals smoothly through the cell's metabolic pathways.
S			1.8.5.1.1.3.1	Fluctuating concentrations of regulators can cause a sophisticated pattern of response in the activity of cellular enzymes.
S			4.3425.1.3	The net effect of a non competitive inhibitor is to change the shape of the enzyme and thus the active site, so that the substrate can no longer interact with the enzyme to give a reaction.
S			1.8.4.4.3.1	Most metabolic reactions are reversible, and an enzyme can catalyze either the forward or the reverse reaction, depending on which direction has a negative deltaG.
S			1.6.4.1.1.3.6	Also, because some of the detoxification enzymes have relatively broad action, the proliferation of smooth ER in response to one drug can increase tolerance to other drugs as well.
S			1.8.2.2.3.4	Unstable systems (top) are rich in free energy, G. They have a tendency to change spontaneously to a more stable state (bottom), and it is possible to harness this "downhill" change to perform work.
S			1.8.2.1.6.2	Such spontaneous changes can be harnessed to perform work.
S			1.8.2.2.6.7	Because a system at equilibrium cannot spontaneously change, it can do no work.
S			1.8.2.2.6.8	A process is spontaneous and can perform work only when it is moving toward equilibrium.

Q	How would locking an enzyme's active site into one conformation affect the enzyme's activity?
A	"It would be severely decreased."
S			1.8.5.1.1.4.1	In another kind of allosteric activation, a substrate molecule binding to one active site in a multisubunit enzyme triggers a shape change in all the subunits, thereby increasing catalytic activity at the other active sites (Figure 8.19b).
S			4.1745.1.1	An enzyme-substrate complex is the complex formed during a chemical reaction (involving only one substrate), when the substrate molecule binds to the active site of the particular enzyme, is an enzyme substrate complex.
S			1.17.5.1.1.3.2	The alteration of a single amino acid in a crucial area of a protein: such as in the part of hemoglobin shown in Figure 17.23 or in the active site of an enzyme as shown in Figure 8.18: will significantly alter protein activity.
S			4.3424.1.1	A noncompetitive inhibitor is a substance that reduces the activity of an enzyme by binding to a location remote from the active site, changing the enzyme's shape so that the active site no longer functions effectively.
S			1.8.4.3.5.3	" The shape that best fits the substrate isn't necessarily the one with the lowest energy, but during the very short time the enzyme takes on this shape, its active site can bind to the substrate.
S			1.8.5.1.2.11.2	The data therefore support the existence of an allosteric inhibitory site on caspase 1 that can be used to control enzymatic activity.
S			1.11.2.3.5	The signaling molecule is complementary in shape to a specific site on the receptor and attaches there, like a key in a lock or a substrate in the catalytic site of an enzyme.
S			1.8.5.1.1.4.3	Cooperativity is considered "allosteric" regulation because binding of the substrate to one active site affects catalysis in another active site.
S			1.14.3.3.1.2	A single tree, locked into its inherited genotype, has leaves that vary in size, shape, and greenness, depending on their exposure to wind and sun.
S			1.8.4.5.3.3.3	This interaction causes the enzyme molecule to change its shape in such a way that the active site becomes less effective at catalyzing the conversion of substrate to product.

Q	What governs a protein's three-dimensional structure and specificity?
A	"Its amino acid sequence."
S			1.5.5.3.2.6	The linear order of bases in a gene specifies the amino acid sequence: the primary structure: of a protein, which in turn specifies that protein's three-dimensional structure and its function in the cell.
S			1.5.4.2.4.1.2	Researchers have tried to correlate the primary structure of many proteins with their three-dimensional structure to discover the rules of protein folding.
S			1.18.2.3.2.4.3	Researchers have identified two common structural elements in a large number of activator proteins: a DNA-binding domain: a part of the protein's three-dimensional structure that binds to DNA: and one or more activation domains.
S			1.17.4.3.1.1.1	During its synthesis, a polypeptide chain begins to coil and fold spontaneously as a consequence of its amino acid sequence (primary structure), forming a protein with a specific shape: a three-dimensional molecule with secondary and tertiary structure (see Figure 5.20).
S			1.5.4.1.1.3	A protein is a biologically functional molecule that consists of one or more polypeptides, each folded and coiled into a specific three-dimensional structure.
S			4.4110.1.1	A protein is a functional biological molecule consisting of one or more polypeptides folded and coiled into a specific three-dimensional structure.
S			1.5.4.2.2.5	And it is the amino acid sequence of each polypeptide that determines what three-dimensional structure the protein will have under normal cellular conditions.

S			1.10.2.2.6.2	Absorption spectra of various chloroplast pigments help scientists decipher each pigment's role in a plant.
S			1.10.0.0.1.2	The chloroplasts of plants capture light energy that has traveled 150 million kilometers from the sun and convert it to chemical energy that is stored in sugar and other organic molecules.
S			1.10.4.4.3.2	The sugar made in the chloroplasts supplies the entire plant with chemical energy and carbon skeletons for the synthesis of all the major organic molecules of plant cells.
S			4.942.1.3	Although the nucleotide sequences of many chloroplast genes from various plant species have been determined, the entire gene organization of the chloroplast genome has not yet been elucidated for any species of plants.
S			1.6.5.3.1.1	Many plants have disk-shaped choloroplasts, as shown here.
S			1.28.5.2.1.1	The grass-green chloroplasts of green algae have a structure and pigment composition much like the chloroplasts of land plants.
S			4.5088.1.6	Although some bacteria have electron transport chains with components similar to those in chloroplasts or mitochondria, others use different electron donors and acceptors.
S			1.10.2.2.27.4	Interestingly, carotenoids similar to the photoprotective ones in chloroplasts have a photoprotective role in the human eye.

Q	What is the final product of glycolysis?
A	"pyruvate"
S			1.9.5.2.1.2	All three use glycolysis to oxidize glucose and other organic fuels to pyruvate, with a net production of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation.
S			1.9.5.7.5	An anaerobic alternative is to transfer electrons from NADH to pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis.
S			1.9.5.2.2.12	The end product of glycolysis, pyruvate, represents a fork in the catabolic pathways of glucose oxidation.
S			1.9.5.1.1.7	Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, serves as an electron acceptor for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which can then be reused in glycolysis.
S			4.4183.1.1	Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis, which is converted into acetyl coA that enters the Krebs cycle when there is sufficient oxygen available.
S			1.11.1.3.1.4	The cell (a liver cell, for example) can then use this compound, an early intermediate in glycolysis, for energy production.
S			1.9.6.4.2	In this section, you will learn that glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are major intersections of the cell's catabolic and anabolic (biosynthetic) pathways.
S			4.4182.1.1	A pyruvate is a 3 carbon molecule which is the product of glycolysis.
S			1.9.5.6.6	Overall, glycolysis is exergonic, and some of the energy made available is used to produce 2 ATP (net) by substrate-level phosphorylation.
S			1.9.4.4.2	But the metabolic components of respiration we have dissected so far, glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, produce only 4 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, all by substrate-level phosphorylation: 2 net ATP from glycolysis and 2 ATP from the citric acid cycle.

Q	What are the products of ATP hydrolysis?
A	"ADP and Pi"
S			1.8.5.1.1.3.2	The products of ATP hydrolysis (ADP and Pi), for example, play a complex role in balancing the flow of traffic between anabolic and catabolic pathways by their effects on key enzymes.
S			1.8.3.2.3.4	In most instances of mechanical work involving motor proteins "walking" along cytoskeletal elements (Figure 8.10b), a cycle occurs in which ATP is first bound noncovalently to the motor protein.
S			1.8.3.1.5.2	The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, as "high-energy" may imply; rather, the reactants (ATP and water) themselves have high energy relative to the energy of the products (ADP and &#9413;i).
S			1.8.3.2.3.2	In these cases, ATP hydrolysis leads to a change in a protein's shape and often its ability to bind another molecule.
S			1.8.3.2.2.7	ATP hydrolysis causes changes in the shapes and binding affinities of proteins.
S			1.8.6.15.2	ATP hydrolysis (sometimes with protein phosphorylation) also causes changes in the shape and binding affinities of transport and motor proteins.
S			1.8.3.2.1.3	For instance, the process of shivering uses ATP hydrolysis during muscle contraction to generate heat and warm the body.
S			4.4142.1.2	Proton-motive force can be generated by a variety of phenomena including the operation of an electron transport chain, illumination of a purple membrane, and the hydrolysis of ATP by a proton atpase.
S			4.1418.1.1	A hydrolysis of atp is the loss of one of three phosphate groups from a molecule of ATP.
S			1.8.3.1.5.3	The release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a state of lower free energy, not from the phosphate bonds themselves.

Q	Thermal energy is another term for what?
A	"heat"
S			1.40.4.6.1.1	Despite their many adaptations for homeostasis, animals may encounter conditions that severely challenge their abilities to balance their heat, energy, and materials budgets.
S			4.70.1.1	Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy (heat, electromagnetic radiation, or electrical energy) required to activate atoms or molecules to a condition in which it is equally likely that they will undergo chemical reaction or transport as it is that they will return to their original state.
S			1.55.1.3.3.1	Another group of heterotrophs is the detritivores, or decomposers, terms we use synonymously in this text to refer to consumers that get their energy from detritus.
S			1.8.1.3.2.2.1	In the process of carrying out chemical reactions that perform various kinds of work, living cells unavoidably convert other forms of energy to heat.
S			1.55.1.1.1.4	Plants and other photosynthetic organisms convert solar energy to chemical energy, but the total amount of energy does not change: The amount of energy stored in organic molecules must equal the total solar energy intercepted by the plant, minus the amounts reflected and dissipated as heat.
S			1.7.3.5.1	Molecules have a type of energy called thermal energy (heat), due to their constant motion.
S			4.3684.1.1	Molecules have intrinsic kinetic energy called thermal motion.
S			1.8.2.3.1.2.7	The word maximum qualifies this statement, because some of the free energy is released as heat and cannot do work.
S			1.8.2.2.5.1	Another term that describes a state of maximum stability is equilibrium, which you learned about in Chapter 2 in connection with chemical reactions.
S			1.10.2.3.2.3	Generally, when isolated pigment molecules absorb light, their excited electrons drop back down to the ground-state orbital in a billionth of a second, releasing their excess energy as heat.

Q	What is the most common catabolic pathway?
A	"aerobic respiration"	"cellular respiration"
S			1.9.1.1.2.2	However, the most prevalent and efficient catabolic pathway is aerobic respiration, in which oxygen is consumed as a reactant along with the organic fuel (aerobic is from the Greek aer, air, and bios, life).
S			1.9.6.3.1.4	The most common mechanism for this control is feedback inhibition: The end product of the anabolic pathway inhibits the enzyme that catalyzes an early step of the pathway (see Figure 8.21).
S			1.9.1.1.9.2	Catabolism is linked to work by a chemical drive shaft: ATP, which you learned about in Chapter 8.
S			1.8.2.3.2.3.4	However, unlike this simple single-step system, a catabolic pathway in a cell releases free energy in a series of reactions.
S			1.18.1.3.4.1	In addition to regulating the lac operon, CAP helps regulate other operons that encode enzymes used in catabolic pathways.
S			1.18.6.6.2	Inducible enzymes usually function in catabolic pathways.
S			1.9.5.2.2.12	The end product of glycolysis, pyruvate, represents a fork in the catabolic pathways of glucose oxidation.
S			1.9.6.3.2.4	Again, control is based mainly on regulating the activity of enzymes at strategic points in the catabolic pathway.
S			1.18.1.2.5.5	In contrast, inducible enzymes usually function in catabolic pathways, which break down a nutrient to simpler molecules.
S			1.9.7.27.1	Describe how the catabolic pathways of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle intersect with anabolic pathways in the metabolism of a cell.

S			1.7.1.1.16.4	The fluid mosaic model is continually being refined.
S			1.7.1.8.4	Let's explore how the fluid mosaic model was developed.
S			1.7.1.4.1.1	Now we come to the mosaic aspect of the fluid mosaic model.
S			1.7.1.1.4.7	Figure 7.3 The original fluid mosaic model for membranes.
S			1.7.6.23.2	According to the fluid mosaic model of membrane structure, proteins of the membrane are mostly
S			1.7.1.1.5.3	In this fluid mosaic model, the membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid bilayer of phospholipids.
S			1.7.2.3.3	We will see once again that form fits function: The fluid mosaic model helps explain how membranes regulate the cell's molecular traffic.
S			1.7.1.8.2	In the fluid mosaic model, the membrane is a fluid structure with a "mosaic" of various proteins embedded in or attached to a double layer (bilayer) of phospholipids.
S			1.7.1.1.16.7	Also, the membrane may be much more packed with proteins than imagined in the classic fluid mosaic model: compare the updated model in Figure 7.5 with the original model in Figure 7.3.

Q	The cell membrane is what kind of bilayer?
A	"lipid bilayer"	"phospholipid bilayers"	"phospholipid bilayer"
S			4.882.1.1	A channel protein is a protein forming an aqueous pore spanning the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane which when open allows certain solutes to traverse the membrane.
S			4.1290.1.1	A hydrophilic channel is a protein forming an aqueous pore spanning the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane which when open allows certain solutes to traverse the membrane

S			4.3449.1.1	Nuclear-Membrane is a double lipid bilayer that acts as a barrier enclosing the genetic material in eukaryotic cells
S			1.7.1.1.6.1	A method of preparing cells for electron microscopy called freeze-fracture has demonstrated visually that proteins are indeed embedded in the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane (Figure 7.4).
S			4.4834.1.1	A study of membrane by electron microscopy is a method of preparing cells for electron microscopy called freeze-fracture has demonstrated visually that proteins are indeed embedded in the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane.
S			1.7.6.4.1	The Davson-Danielli sandwich model of the membrane has been replaced by the fluid mosaic model, in which amphipathic proteins are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer.
S			1.7.1.1.2.3	Ten years later, two Dutch scientists reasoned that cell membranes must be phospholipid bilayers.
S			4.3913.1.1	Plasma-membrane is a lipid bilayer that acts as a barrier enclosing cell.
S			1.7.5.3.1	Water and small solutes enter and leave the cell by diffusing through the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane or by being pumped or moved across the membrane by transport proteins.

Q	What molecule enters the citric acid cycle?
A	"acetyl CoA"
S			1.9.6.1.1.3	Monomers of these molecules enter glycolysis or the citric acid cycle at various points.
S			1.10.3.1.1	The Calvin cycle is similar to the citric acid cycle in that a starting material is regenerated after molecules enter and leave the cycle.
S			1.9.4.3.3.7	The citric acid cycle also supplies electrons to the electron transport chain via FADH2, but since its electrons enter later in the chain, each molecule of this electron carrier is responsible for transport of only enough H+ for the synthesis of 1.5 ATP.
S			1.9.3.2.3.3	You can see in Figure 9.12 that for each turn of the citric acid cycle, two carbons (red) enter in the relatively reduced form of an acetyl group (step 1), and two different carbons (blue) leave in the completely oxidized form of CO2 molecules (steps 3 and 4).
S			1.9.3.2.2.6	Figure 9.12 A closer look at the citric acid cycle.
S			1.9.3.1.1.4	The acetyl group of acetyl CoA will enter the citric acid cycle.

S			1.9.3.1.1.1	Figure 9.10 Oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the step before the citric acid cycle.
S			1.9.6.2.2.1	In addition, glycolysis and the citric acid cycle function as metabolic interchanges that enable our cells to convert some kinds of molecules to others as we need them.
S			4.1166.1.1	A conversion of fumarate to malate is a intermediate step within the Citric Acid cycle, in which addition of a water molecule rearranges bonds to convert fumarate to malate.

Q	What is the net energy yield of glycolysis?
A	"2 ATP plus 2 NADH"
S			1.9.2.2.4	The net energy yield from glycolysis, per glucose molecule, is 2 ATP plus 2 NADH.
S			1.11.1.3.1.4	The cell (a liver cell, for example) can then use this compound, an early intermediate in glycolysis, for energy production.
S			4.5306.1.1	In glycolysis, during energy payoff phase 2-phosphoglycerate is formed from 3-phosphoglycerate.
S			4.3776.1.1	In glycolysis, during energy payoff phase phosphoenolpyruvate is formed from 2-phosphoglycerate.
S			1.9.2.2.1	As summarized in Figure 9.8, glycolysis can be divided into two phases: energy investment and energy payoff.
S			1.9.5.6.6	Overall, glycolysis is exergonic, and some of the energy made available is used to produce 2 ATP (net) by substrate-level phosphorylation.
S			1.9.2.1.8	Figure 9.8 The energy input and output of glycolysis.
S			1.9.3.1.2.2	This step, linking glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, is carried out by a multienzyme complex that catalyzes three reactions: &#x278A; Pyruvate's carboxyl group (: COO-'), which is already fully oxidized and thus has little chemical energy, is removed and given off as a molecule of CO2.
S			1.9.5.2.1.2	All three use glycolysis to oxidize glucose and other organic fuels to pyruvate, with a net production of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation.
S			1.55.3.1.4.1	Net secondary production is the energy stored in biomass represented by growth and reproduction.

Q	What is the direct product of photosynthesis?
A	"a three-carbon sugar"	"sugars"
S			1.10.0.0.4.8	Almost all heterotrophs, including humans, are completely dependent, either directly or indirectly, on photoautotrophs for food: and also for oxygen, a by-product of photosynthesis.
S			1.10.1.2.3.1	We use glucose (C6H12O6) here to simplify the relationship between photosynthesis and respiration, but the direct product of photosynthesis is actually a three-carbon sugar that can be used to make glucose.
S			1.39.1.3.3.1.2	Many are enzymes that function in photosynthesis directly; others are enzymes involved in supplying the chemical precursors necessary for chlorophyll production; still others affect the levels of plant hormones that regulate growth.
S			1.55.2.9.3	These photosynthetic products are the starting point for most studies of ecosystem metabolism and energy flow.
S			1.10.1.3.6.3	The two stages of photosynthesis are treated in this figure as metabolic modules that take in ingredients and crank out products.
S			1.55.2.1.2.17.3	Because O2 release is directly coupled to photosynthesis and respiration (see Figure 9.2), a system that is giving off O2 is also storing carbon.
S			1.2.2.4.5.9	(Indeed, this is the first step taken when plants harness the energy of sunlight for photosynthesis, the process that produces food from carbon dioxide and water. )
S			1.36.1.6.3	The phloem transports products of photosynthesis from where they are made or stored to where they are needed.
S			1.35.1.2.14.4	Phloem transports sugars, the products of photosynthesis, from where they are made (usually the leaves) to where they are needed: usually roots and sites of growth, such as developing leaves and fruits.
S			1.10.4.4.6.2	Furthermore, in terms of food production, the collective productivity of the minuscule chloroplasts is prodigious: Photosynthesis makes an estimated 160 billion metric tons of carbohydrate per year (a metric ton is 1,000 kg, about 1.1 tons).

Q	What categories of organisms have cell walls?
A	"fungi"	"Halobacterium"	"bacteria"	"plant"
S			1.28.3.2.1.2.1	Diatoms are unicellular algae that have a unique glass-like wall made of hydrated silica (silicon dioxide) embedded in an organic matrix.
S			1.7.3.1.1.4.5	In hypertonic or hypotonic environments, however, organisms that lack rigid cell walls must have other adaptations for osmoregulation, the control of solute concentrations and water balance.
S			1.27.4.2.3.3	For example, the proteins and cell wall of Halobacterium have unusual features that improve function in extremely salty environments but render these organisms incapable of survival if the salinity drops below 9%.
S			4.2086.1.4	True fungi do not have cellulose in their cell walls, but some fungus-like organisms do.
S			1.27.3.4.2	Like all organisms, prokaryotes can be categorized by how they obtain energy and the carbon used in building the organic molecules that make up cells.
S			1.10.4.4.4.6	Cellulose, the main ingredient of cell walls, is the most abundant organic molecule in the plant: and probably on the surface of the planet.
S			1.25.3.1.2.1.3	Also, unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells have a cytoskeleton, a feature that enables eukaryotic cells to change their shape and thereby surround and engulf other cells.
S			1.38.3.2.2.2.3	Instead, the polymers in cell walls, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, which constitute the most abundant organic compounds on Earth, would be broken down into sugars by enzymatic reactions.
S			4.3576.1.3	Since the cell sap has a lower water potential than that of the solution outside the living cell, water enters the cell by osmosis (endosmosis).
S			4.3577.1.1	An osmoregulation in organism with cell without cell-wall in hypertonic solution is an organism with a cell without cell wall when placed in a hypertonic solution will lose water to its environment, shrivel, and probably die.

Q	What are the two types of transport proteins?
A	"channel proteins and carrier proteins"	"channel proteins and carrier proteins."	"channel proteins, carrier proteins, and cotransporters"
S			1.7.3.2.1.6	Figure 7.17 Two types of transport proteins that carry out facilitated diffusion.
S			1.7.3.2.2.1	As described earlier, the two types of transport proteins are channel proteins and carrier proteins.
S			4.3475.1.1	A nucleosome is the basic, bead-like unit of DNA packing in eukaryotes, consisting of a segment of DNA wound around a protein core composed of two copies of each of four types of histone.
S			1.17.1.1.2.1.6	For example, hemoglobin, the oxygen-transporting protein of vertebrate red blood cells, contains two kinds of polypeptides, and thus two genes code for this protein (see Figure 5.20).
S			1.36.2.2.1.2	Both active and passive transport mechanisms occur in plants, and plant cell membranes are equipped with the same general types of pumps and transport proteins (channel proteins, carrier proteins, and cotransporters) that function in other cells.
S			1.9.4.1.4.4	The electron transport chain has several types of cytochromes, each a different protein with a slightly different electron-carrying heme group.
S			1.8.3.2.1.5	Instead, the cell's proteins harness the energy released during ATP hydrolysis in several ways to perform the three types of cellular work: chemical, transport, and mechanical.
S			1.7.6.8.7	In a type of passive transport called facilitated diffusion, a transport protein speeds the movement of water or a solute across a membrane down its concentration gradient.
S			1.11.2.1.1.3	We can see how cell-surface transmembrane receptors work by looking at three major types: G protein-coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, and ion channel receptors.
S			1.7.3.2.1.7	In both cases, the protein can transport the solute in either direction, but the net movement is down the concentration gradient of the solute.

Q	What molecules does the hydrolysis of ATP yield?
A	"ADP and inorganic phosphate"	"inorganic phosphate and ADP"
S			1.8.3.2.3.2	In these cases, ATP hydrolysis leads to a change in a protein's shape and often its ability to bind another molecule.
S			1.17.4.2.1.4	It is provided by the hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), a molecule closely related to ATP.
S			4.1418.1.1	A hydrolysis of atp is the loss of one of three phosphate groups from a molecule of ATP.
S			1.8.3.2.1.3	For instance, the process of shivering uses ATP hydrolysis during muscle contraction to generate heat and warm the body.
S			4.4142.1.2	Proton-motive force can be generated by a variety of phenomena including the operation of an electron transport chain, illumination of a purple membrane, and the hydrolysis of ATP by a proton atpase.
S			1.40.4.1.2.3	Most nutrient molecules are used to generate ATP.
S			4.3780.1.3	The process yields two 3-phosphoglyceric acid molecules and two ATP
S			4.4184.1.3	This reaction yields 2 molecules of pyruvic acid and 2 ATP molecules.
S			1.9.2.2.4	The net energy yield from glycolysis, per glucose molecule, is 2 ATP plus 2 NADH.
S			1.9.4.3.1.3	Figure 9.16 ATP yield per molecule of glucose at each stage of cellular respiration.

Q	What reactant becomes oxidized in photosynthesis?
A	"sugars"	"H2O"
S			4.5088.1.3	Electron transport chains are the cellular mechanisms used for extracting energy from sunlight in photosynthesis and also from redox reactions, such as the oxidation of sugars (respiration).
S			4.4406.1.1	Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) is the molecule that carbon dioxide reacts with in photosynthetic carbon fixation.
S			1.25.3.1.1.1.2	When oxygenic photosynthesis first evolved, the free O2 it produced probably dissolved in the surrounding water until it reached a high enough concentration to react with dissolved iron.
S			1.56.1.3.4.2.2	The burning of wood and fossil fuels releases oxides of sulfur and nitrogen that react with water in air, forming sulfuric and nitric acids.
S			4.53.1.1	A  nitric acid formation in atmosphere is a nitrogen oxides, released into the atmosphere by the burning of wood and fossil fuels, react with water molecules in the air forming nitric acids which fall to the Earth's surface as precipitation.
S			4.54.1.1	A sulphuric acid formation in atmosphere is a sulfur oxides, released into the atmosphere by the burning of wood and fossil fuels, react with water molecules in the air forming sulfuric acids which fall to the Earth's surface as precipitation.
S			1.9.1.2.2.3.4	In respiration, the oxidation of glucose transfers electrons to a lower energy state, liberating energy that becomes available for ATP synthesis.
S			1.27.3.3.4.3	In turn, the bacteria produce sulfur compounds that the archaea use as oxidizing agents when they consume methane in the absence of oxygen.
S			1.55.0.0.2.6	When the water flows from the base of the glacier and comes into contact with air, the reduced iron in the water is oxidized and turns red before the water freezes.
S			1.9.3.2.3.3	You can see in Figure 9.12 that for each turn of the citric acid cycle, two carbons (red) enter in the relatively reduced form of an acetyl group (step 1), and two different carbons (blue) leave in the completely oxidized form of CO2 molecules (steps 3 and 4).

Q	During glycolysis, what is glucose broken into?
A	"two pyruvate molecules"	"two molecules of pyruvate"	"two molecules of a compound called pyruvate"	"G3P"
S			1.9.1.3.2.4	During glycolysis, each glucose molecule is broken down into two molecules of the compound pyruvate.
S			1.9.3.2.1.3	To calculate on a per-glucose basis, multiply by 2, because each glucose molecule is split during glycolysis into two pyruvate molecules.
S			4.2263.1.1	Glycolysis is the splitting of glucose into pyruvate.
S			1.9.1.3.3.2	Glycolysis, which occurs in the cytosol, begins the degradation process by breaking glucose into two molecules of a compound called pyruvate.
S			4.2265.1.1	Glycolysis reaction is the chemical reactions which are part of the process of glycolysis, which splits glucose into pyruvate and produces energy in the form of ATP.
S			1.9.4.1.3.3	Electrons removed from glucose by NAD+, during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are transferred from NADH to the first molecule of the electron transport chain in complex I. This molecule is a flavoprotein, so named because it has a prosthetic group called flavin mononucleotide (FMN).
S			1.9.2.1.1	The word glycolysis means "sugar splitting," and that is exactly what happens during this pathway.
S			1.9.2.3.1	All of the carbon originally present in glucose is accounted for in the two molecules of pyruvate; no carbon is released as CO2 during glycolysis.
S			1.10.3.4.5	G3P is a sugar: the same three-carbon sugar formed in glycolysis by the splitting of glucose (see Figure 9.9).
S			1.9.6.1.3.2	In the digestive tract, starch is hydrolyzed to glucose, which can then be broken down in the cells by glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.

Q	The head of the phospholipid is polar or nonpolar?
A	"polar"
S			1.5.3.2.1.2	A phospholipid has a hydrophilic (polar) head and two hydrophobic (nonpolar) tails.
S			4.3783.1.2	The hydrocarbon chains of the fatty acids act as nonpolar, hydrophobic tails, while the rest of the molecule acts as a polar, hydrophilic head.
S			1.7.2.1.1.2	However, the hydrophobic interior of the membrane impedes the direct passage of ions and polar molecules, which are hydrophilic, through the membrane.
S			1.7.6.6.2	Hydrophobic substances are soluble in lipid and pass through membranes rapidly, whereas polar molecules and ions generally require specific transport proteins to cross the membrane.
S			1.5.3.2.2.6	Additional small molecules, which are usually charged or polar, can be linked to the phosphate group to form a variety of phospholipids.
S			1.7.2.2.1.1	Cell membranes are permeable to specific ions and a variety of polar molecules.
S			1.2.5.12.1	In terms of electron sharing between atoms, compare nonpolar covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, and the formation of ions.
S			1.3.2.4.4.4	Many different kinds of polar compounds are dissolved (along with ions) in the water of such biological fluids as blood, the sap of plants, and the liquid within all cells.
S			1.7.3.2.1.2	As mentioned earlier, many polar molecules and ions impeded by the lipid bilayer of the membrane diffuse passively with the help of transport proteins that span the membrane.
S			1.3.2.4.4.1	A compound does not need to be ionic to dissolve in water; many compounds made up of nonionic polar molecules, such as sugars, are also water-soluble.

Q	What is the major organ of photosynthesis in plants?
A	"Leaf"	"leaf"	"the leaf"	"leaves"	"Leaves"
S			1.10.1.1.1.2	Leaves are the major organs of photosynthesis in plants.
S			1.35.1.1.3.1.1	In most vascular plants, the leaf is the main photosynthetic organ, although green stems also perform photosynthesis.
S			1.5.2.1.6.6	Plants generally transport carbohydrates from leaves to roots and other nonphotosynthetic organs in the form of sucrose.
S			1.10.1.1.2.1	All green parts of a plant, including green stems and unripened fruit, have chloroplasts, but the leaves are the major sites of photosynthesis in most plants (Figure 10.4).
S			1.35.1.1.4.1	In describing plant organs, we'll draw examples mainly from the two major groups of angiosperms: monocots and eudicots (see Figure 30.13).
S			1.39.2.2.1.16	Abscisic acid (ABA) Almost all plant cells have the ability to synthesize abscisic acid, and its presence has been detected in every major organ and living tissue; may be transported in the phloem or xylem.
S			1.36.5.1.3.2	A sugar source is a plant organ that is a net producer of sugar, by photosynthesis or by breakdown of starch.

S			1.10.1.3.4.7	Thus, light energy is initially converted to chemical energy in the form of two compounds: NADPH, a source of electrons as "reducing power" that can be passed along to an electron acceptor, reducing it, and ATP, the versatile energy currency of cells.
S			1.10.2.5.9.1	Photoexcited electrons are passed in a series of redox reactions from the primary electron acceptor of PS I down a second electron transport chain through the protein ferredoxin (Fd).

Q	What color does a solution of chlorophyll fluoresce?
A	"red-orange"
S			4.4276.1.1	A red algae is a photosynthetic protist, named for its color, which results from a red pigment that masks the green of chlorophyll.

S			1.10.2.2.1.2	The chlorophyll molecules of chloroplasts absorb violet-blue and red light (the colors most effective in driving photosynthesis) and reflect or transmit green light.
S			1.10.2.2.15.3	The spectrum of chlorophyll a suggests that violet-blue and red light work best for photosynthesis, since they are absorbed, while green is the least effective color.
S			1.39.1.3.2.2.2	For example, some Arabidopsis mutants, except for their pale color, have a light-grown morphology when grown in the dark; they have expanded leaves and short, sturdy stems but are not green because the final step in chlorophyll production requires light directly.

S			1.10.2.2.6.2	Absorption spectra of various chloroplast pigments help scientists decipher each pigment's role in a plant.
S			1.10.2.2.26.2	This is partly because accessory pigments with different absorption spectra are also photosynthetically important in chloroplasts and broaden the spectrum of colors that can be used for photosynthesis.
S			1.10.2.2.15.1	The absorption spectra of chloroplast pigments provide clues to the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths for driving photosynthesis, since light can perform work in chloroplasts only if it is absorbed.

S			1.10.1.3.4.7	Thus, light energy is initially converted to chemical energy in the form of two compounds: NADPH, a source of electrons as "reducing power" that can be passed along to an electron acceptor, reducing it, and ATP, the versatile energy currency of cells.
S			1.9.1.2.2.3.1	In general, organic molecules that have an abundance of hydrogen are excellent fuels because their bonds are a source of "hilltop" electrons, whose energy may be released as these electrons "fall" down an energy gradient when they are transferred to oxygen.

S			4.659.1.1	A C4 plant is a plant in which the Calvin cycle is preceded by reactions that incorporate CO2 into a four-carbon compound, the end product of which supplies CO2 for the Calvin cycle.
S			1.10.4.1.3.3	Researchers consider this clear evidence that photorespiration acts to neutralize the otherwise damaging products of the light reactions, which build up when a low CO2 concentration limits the progress of the Calvin cycle.
S			1.8.1.3.2.4.4	As the bear in Figure 8.3b converts chemical energy to kinetic energy, it is also increasing the disorder of its surroundings by producing heat and small molecules, such as the CO2 it exhales, that are the breakdown products of food.

Q	When calculating free energy, what values are held constant?
A	"temperature and pressure"
S			1.8.2.2.4.1	We can think of free energy as a measure of a system's instability: its tendency to change to a more stable state.
S			1.8.2.2.3.4	Unstable systems (top) are rich in free energy, G. They have a tendency to change spontaneously to a more stable state (bottom), and it is possible to harness this "downhill" change to perform work.
S			1.8.4.1.4.3	As the atoms then settle into their new, more stable bonding arrangements, energy is released to the surroundings.
S			1.8.2.2.3.2	Because it has less free energy, the system in its final state is less likely to change and is therefore more stable than it was previously.
S			1.8.4.1.1.7	When the new bonds of the product molecules form, energy is released as heat, and the molecules return to stable shapes with lower energy than the contorted state.
S			1.8.2.1.2.1	The change in free energy, deltaG, can be calculated for a chemical reaction by applying the following equation:
S			1.3.2.2.1.1.5	For a given body of matter, the amount of heat is a measure of the matter's total kinetic energy due to motion of its molecules; thus, heat depends in part on the matter's volume.

S			1.10.2.7.1.17	The diffusion of H+ from the thylakoid space back to the stroma (along the H+ concentration gradient) powers the ATP synthase.
S			1.10.2.7.1.14	As electrons pass from carrier to carrier in redox reactions, hydrogen ions removed from the stroma are deposited in the thylakoid space, storing energy as a proton-motive force (H+ gradient).
S			1.10.2.7.2.6	In the chloroplast, ATP is synthesized as the hydrogen ions diffuse from the thylakoid space back to the stroma through ATP synthase complexes, whose catalytic knobs are on the stroma side of the membrane.
S			1.10.2.7.2.4	If you imagine the cristae of mitochondria pinching off from the inner membrane, this may help you see how the thylakoid space and the intermembrane space are comparable spaces in the two organelles, while the mitochondrial matrix is analogous to the stroma of the chloroplast.

S			1.8.2.3.2.3.4	However, unlike this simple single-step system, a catabolic pathway in a cell releases free energy in a series of reactions.
S			1.8.1.2.3.11	Biochemical pathways, carried out in the context of cellular structures, enable cells to release chemical energy from food molecules and use the energy to power life processes.

S			1.9.1.7.1	As you learned in Chapter 8, metabolic pathways that release stored energy by breaking down complex molecules are called catabolic pathways.
S			1.9.1.2.3.5.8	Second, instead of occurring in one explosive reaction, respiration uses an electron transport chain to break the fall of electrons to oxygen into several energy-releasing steps (Figure 9.5b).
S			1.9.1.3.5.4	The energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion (or prokaryotic cell) can use to make ATP from ADP.

S			1.8.1.3.3.2.9	On a larger scale, energy flows into most ecosystems in the form of light and exits in the form of heat (see Figure 1.6).
S			1.42.7.2.1.2	For example, a person requires almost 2 L of O2 per minute during intense exercise, and all of it must be carried in the blood from the lungs to the active tissues.
S			1.30.3.1.1.1.2	In many angiosperm species, insects or other animals transfer pollen from one flower to the sex organs on another flower, which makes pollination more directed than the wind-dependent pollination of most gymnosperms.

Q	What products of the light reactions are used during the Calvin cycle?
A	"ATP and NADPH"	"NADPH and ATP"
S			1.10.2.7.5.6	Let's now see how the Calvin cycle uses the products of the light reactions to synthesize sugar from CO2.
S			1.10.4.3.1.7	During the day, when the light reactions can supply ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle, CO2 is released from the organic acids made the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts.
S			1.10.1.3.5.9	Nevertheless, the Calvin cycle in most plants occurs during daylight, for only then can the light reactions provide the NADPH and ATP that the Calvin cycle requires.
S			1.10.4.1.3.3	Researchers consider this clear evidence that photorespiration acts to neutralize the otherwise damaging products of the light reactions, which build up when a low CO2 concentration limits the progress of the Calvin cycle.
S			1.10.4.4.1.2	This diagram outlines the main reactants and products of the light reactions and the Calvin cycle as they occur in the chloroplasts of plant cells.
S			1.10.1.3.2.3	These two stages of photosynthesis are known as the light reactions (the photo part of photosynthesis) and the Calvin cycle (the synthesis part) (Figure 10.6).
S			1.10.2.7.2.7	Thus, ATP forms in the stroma, where it is used to help drive sugar synthesis during the Calvin cycle (Figure 10.18).
S			1.10.2.6.5.2	Before we move on to consider the Calvin cycle, let's review chemiosmosis, the process that uses membranes to couple redox reactions to ATP production.

S			1.7.1.4.2.1	Notice in Figure 7.5 that there are two major populations of membrane proteins: integral proteins and peripheral proteins.
S			4.3721.1.1	A peripheral protein is a protein loosely bound to the surface of a membrane or to part of an integral protein and not embedded in the lipid bilayer.
S			1.7.1.4.2.7	Peripheral proteins are not embedded in the lipid bilayer at all; they are appendages loosely bound to the surface of the membrane, often to exposed parts of integral proteins (see Figure 7.5).

S			1.6.5.1.3.2	The model it proposes is consistent with many structural features of mitochondria and chloroplasts.
S			1.6.5.1.2.1	EVOLUTION   Mitochondria and chloroplasts display similarities with bacteria that led to the endosymbiont theory, illustrated in Figure 6.16.
S			1.6.2.2.5.2	After carefully reviewing Figure 6.8, briefly describe the structure and function of the nucleus, the mitochondrion, the chloroplast, and the endoplasmic reticulum.
S			1.10.2.7.1.5	Some of the electron carriers, including the iron-containing proteins called cytochromes, are very similar in chloroplasts and mitochondria.
S			4.5088.1.6	Although some bacteria have electron transport chains with components similar to those in chloroplasts or mitochondria, others use different electron donors and acceptors.

Q	What about an enzyme changes when a substrate binds to its activation site?
A	"shape of the active site"	"shape change in all its subunits"
S			1.8.5.1.1.4.1	In another kind of allosteric activation, a substrate molecule binding to one active site in a multisubunit enzyme triggers a shape change in all the subunits, thereby increasing catalytic activity at the other active sites (Figure 8.19b).
S			1.8.4.4.2.1	In most enzymatic reactions, the substrate is held in the active site by so-called weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds.
S			1.8.4.6.1.5	In the case of an enzyme, if the changed amino acids are in the active site or some other crucial region, the altered enzyme might have a novel activity or might bind to a different substrate.
S			4.2619.1.1	Induced by entry of the substrate, the change in shape of the active site of an enzyme so that it binds more snugly to the substrate.
S			4.1745.1.1	An enzyme-substrate complex is the complex formed during a chemical reaction (involving only one substrate), when the substrate molecule binds to the active site of the particular enzyme, is an enzyme substrate complex.
S			1.8.4.4.4.3	Second, as the active site of an enzyme clutches the bound substrates, the enzyme may stretch the substrate molecules toward their transition-state form, stressing and bending critical chemical bonds that must be broken during the reaction.
S			1.8.4.5.3.3.1	In contrast, noncompetitive inhibitors do not directly compete with the substrate to bind to the enzyme at the active site (Figure 8.17c).
S			1.8.4.3.5.3	" The shape that best fits the substrate isn't necessarily the one with the lowest energy, but during the very short time the enzyme takes on this shape, its active site can bind to the substrate.
S			1.11.2.3.5	The signaling molecule is complementary in shape to a specific site on the receptor and attaches there, like a key in a lock or a substrate in the catalytic site of an enzyme.
S			4.75.1.1	In molecular biology, the active site is part of an enzyme where substrates bind and undergo a chemical reaction.

S			1.9.3.3.2	If molecular oxygen is present, the pyruvate enters a mitochondrion (in eukaryotic cells), where the oxidation of glucose is completed.
S			1.9.3.1.1.2	Pyruvate is a charged molecule, so in eukaryotic cells it must enter the mitochondrion via active transport, with the help of a transport protein.
S			4.3173.1.1	The mitochondrial matrix contains soluble enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of pyruvate and other small organic molecules.
S			1.9.1.3.3.3	In eukaryotes, pyruvate enters the mitochondrion and is oxidized to a compound called acetyl CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle.

A	"sunlight"	"light"
S			1.55.3.2.11.2	Tobacco leaves contain nicotine, a poisonous compound that is energetically expensive for the plant to make.
S			1.8.2.3.2.3.9	As long as our cells have a steady supply of glucose or other fuels and oxygen and are able to expel waste products to the surroundings, their metabolic pathways never reach equilibrium and can continue to do the work of life.
S			1.10.0.0.8.2	To produce "bioethanol," the starch made naturally by the plants is simply converted to glucose and then fermented to ethanol by microorganisms.
S			1.10.4.4.4.5	A considerable amount of sugar in the form of glucose is linked together to make the polysaccharide cellulose, especially in plant cells that are still growing and maturing.
S			4.4186.1.4	It can be made from glucose through glycolysis, supplies energy to living cells in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and can also be converted to carbohydrates via gluconeogenesis, to fatty acids or energy through acetyl-CoA, to the amino acid alanine and to ethanol.
S			1.29.3.1.1.2.5	Until you have a chance to do that, you can study the sporophyte-dominant life cycle of seedless vascular plants in Figure 29.13, which uses a fern as an example.
S			1.8.2.3.1.9.2	Plants get the required energy: 686 kcal to make a mole of glucose: from the environment by capturing light and converting its energy to chemical energy.
S			1.5.2.2.2.6.5	Chitin is similar to cellulose, with beta linkages, except that the glucose monomer of chitin has a nitrogen-containing appendage (see Figure 5.9a).

S			4.3234.1.1	Morphogenesis is the biological process that causes a plant to develop its shape.

Q	What is the name for a molecule with both a hydrophobic and hydrophilic region?
A	"amphipathic"	"amphipathic molecule"
S			1.7.1.7.4	A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has both a hydrophilic region and a hydrophobic region (see Figure 5.12).
S			4.205.1.1	An amphipathic molecule is a molecules which contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic region.
S			1.7.1.1.5.2	This molecular arrangement would maximize contact of hydrophilic regions of proteins and phospholipids with water in the cytosol and extracellular fluid, while providing their hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment.
S			1.7.1.1.2.4	Such a double layer of molecules could exist as a stable boundary between two aqueous compartments because the molecular arrangement shelters the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids from water while exposing the hydrophilic heads to water (Figure 7.2).
S			1.5.3.2.2.9	Note that the hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids are in contact with water in this structure, whereas the hydrophobic tails are in contact with each other and remote from water.
S			1.7.1.2.2.4	It is quite rare, however, for a molecule to flip-flop transversely across the membrane, switching from one phospholipid layer to the other; to do so, the hydrophilic part of the molecule must cross the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.
S			1.2.3.4.2.4	For atoms with valence electrons in both s and p orbitals (review Figure 2.10), the single s and three p orbitals form four new hybrid orbitals shaped like identical teardrops extending from the region of the atomic nucleus (Figure 2.17a).
S			1.7.1.7.6	Furthermore, most of the proteins within membranes have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions.
S			4.2520.1.1	A hydrophilic head is the "head" part of a molecule that is polar (having a partial charge due to electronegativity) and therefore does not resist interaction with water.
S			1.4.2.2.1.1.5	This colorized TEM shows part of a human adipose cell with many fat droplets, each containing a large number of fat molecules.

Q	What type of transport proteins move solutes against their concentration gradient?
A	"carrier proteins"
S			1.7.6.8.7	In a type of passive transport called facilitated diffusion, a transport protein speeds the movement of water or a solute across a membrane down its concentration gradient.
S			1.7.3.2.1.7	In both cases, the protein can transport the solute in either direction, but the net movement is down the concentration gradient of the solute.
S			1.7.4.4.3	Some transport proteins, however, can move solutes against their concentration gradients, across the plasma membrane from the side where they are less concentrated (whether inside or outside) to the side where they are more concentrated.
S			1.7.4.1.1.3	The transport proteins that move solutes against their concentration gradients are all carrier proteins rather than channel proteins.
S			1.7.4.4.1	Despite the help of transport proteins, facilitated diffusion is considered passive transport because the solute is moving down its concentration gradient, a process that requires no energy.
S			1.7.4.1.1.4	This makes sense because when channel proteins are open, they merely allow solutes to diffuse down their concentration gradients rather than picking them up and transporting them against their gradients.
S			1.7.6.10.1	Specific membrane proteins use energy, usually in the form of ATP, to do the work of active transport.
S			4.76.1.1	The movement of a substance across a cell membrane, with an expenditure of energy, against its concentration or electrochemical gradient; mediated by specific transport proteins.
S			4.79.1.1	Active transport using ATP is the movement of a substance across a cell membrane, with an expenditure of energy derived from ATP, against its concentration or electrochemical gradient; mediated by specific transport proteins.

Q	If the lights are turned off, what happens to the proton gradient in chloroplasts?
A	"the pH gradient is abolished"
S			1.10.2.7.3.4	If in the laboratory the lights are turned off, the pH gradient is abolished, but it can quickly be restored by turning the lights back on.
S			1.9.4.2.5.4	Chloroplasts use chemiosmosis to generate ATP during photosynthesis; in these organelles, light (rather than chemical energy) drives both electron flow down an electron transport chain and the resulting H+ gradient formation.
S			1.10.2.2.15.1	The absorption spectra of chloroplast pigments provide clues to the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths for driving photosynthesis, since light can perform work in chloroplasts only if it is absorbed.
S			1.10.4.3.1.7	During the day, when the light reactions can supply ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle, CO2 is released from the organic acids made the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts.
S			1.10.2.7.1.3	In this way, electron transport chains transform redox energy to a proton-motive force, potential energy stored in the form of an H+ gradient across a membrane.
S			1.10.2.7.2.5	In the mitochondrion, protons diffuse down their concentration gradient from the intermembrane space through ATP synthase to the matrix, driving ATP synthesis.
S			1.10.2.7.1.14	As electrons pass from carrier to carrier in redox reactions, hydrogen ions removed from the stroma are deposited in the thylakoid space, storing energy as a proton-motive force (H+ gradient).
S			4.18.1.2	This energy is often in the form of protons moving down an electrochemical gradient, such as from the lumen into the stroma of chloroplasts or from the inter-membrane space into the matrix in mitochondria.
S			1.9.1.2.2.3.1	In general, organic molecules that have an abundance of hydrogen are excellent fuels because their bonds are a source of "hilltop" electrons, whose energy may be released as these electrons "fall" down an energy gradient when they are transferred to oxygen.
S			1.10.2.5.7.2	As electrons pass through the cytochrome complex, H+ are pumped into the thylakoid lumen, contributing to the proton gradient that is subsequently used in chemiosmosis.

Q	What wavelength of light is best absorbed in the reaction-center chlorophyll a of photosystem I?
A	"700 nm"
S			1.10.2.4.4.5	The reaction-center chlorophyll a of photosystem II is known as P680 because this pigment is best at absorbing light having a wavelength of 680 nm (in the red part of the spectrum).
S			1.10.2.4.4.6	The chlorophyll a at the reaction-center complex of photosystem I is called P700 because it most effectively absorbs light of wavelength 700 nm (in the far-red part of the spectrum).
S			4.36.1.1	An accessory pigment is antennae pigments found in photosynthetic organisms, that work in conjunction with other pigments to absorb light and transfer that light energy to photosystem chlorophyll.
S			4.5172.1.2	Plastocyanin transfers an electron to chlorophyll P-700 in the reaction center of photosystem I.
S			4.3630.1.1	P700, or Photosystem I primary donor, (where P stands for pigment) is the reaction-center chlorophyll a molecule in association with photosystem I.
S			1.10.5.12.3	Photosystem II contains P680 chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction-center complex; photosystem I contains P700 molecules.
S			4.3825.1.2	There are two types of photosystems, I and II; they absorb light best at different wavelengths.
S			1.10.2.4.3.5	Thus, each photosystem: a reaction-center complex surrounded by light-harvesting complexes: functions in the chloroplast as a unit.
S			4.3827.1.1	Photosystem I is a one of two light-capturing units in a chloroplast's thylakoid membrane or in the membrane of some prokaryotes; it has two molecules of P700 at its reaction center.
S			4.3829.1.1	Photosystem II is a one of two light-capturing units in a chloroplast's thylakoid membrane or in the membrane of some prokaryotes; it has two molecules of P680 at its reaction center.

A	"chemiosmosis"	"bioluminescence"	"cellular respiration"	"the light reactions"
S			1.8.1.2.1.2	In everyday life, energy is important because some forms of energy can be used to do work: that is, to move matter against opposing forces, such as gravity and friction.

Q	What are two different types of molecules on the cell membrane that vary between different cell types?
A	"lipids and proteins"
S			1.7.1.2.14.1	The steroid cholesterol, which is wedged between phospholipid molecules in the plasma membranes of animal cells, has different effects on membrane fluidity at different temperatures (Figure 7.8b).
S			1.50.1.2.2.2.2	For pheromones and other molecules detected by chemoreceptors, the stimulus molecule binds to the specific receptor on the membrane of the sensory cell and initiates changes in ion permeability.
S			1.6.6.2.1.7.4	Membrane proteins on this kind of cilium transmit molecular signals from the cell's environment to its interior, triggering signaling pathways that may lead to changes in the cell's activities.
S			1.43.1.2.2.2.5	Similarly, TLR4, located on immune cell plasma membranes, recognizes lipopolysaccharide, a type of molecule found on the surface of many bacteria; and TLR5 recognizes flagellin, the main protein of bacterial flagella.

S			1.7.1.5.3.1	The carbohydrates on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane vary from species to species, among individuals of the same species, and even from one cell type to another in a single individual.
S			4.664.1.1	CD4 is a surface protein, present on most helper T cells, that binds to class II MHC molecules, enhancing the interaction between the T cell and an antigen-presenting cell.

S			1.2.3.4.5.4	Opiates, such as morphine and heroin, relieve pain and alter mood by weakly binding to specific receptor molecules on the surfaces of brain cells.

Q	Within the membrane, in which direction are most lipids and some proteins most frequently able to shift?
A	"laterally"
S			1.7.1.2.2.3	Most of the lipids and some of the proteins can shift about laterally: that is, in the plane of the membrane, like partygoers elbowing their way through a crowded room (Figure 7.6).
S			1.7.1.2.15.2	When a membrane solidifies, its permeability changes, and enzymatic proteins in the membrane may become inactive if their activity requires them to be able to move within the membrane.
S			1.7.1.4.2.7	Peripheral proteins are not embedded in the lipid bilayer at all; they are appendages loosely bound to the surface of the membrane, often to exposed parts of integral proteins (see Figure 7.5).
S			1.7.1.3.2.1	The ability to change the lipid composition of cell membranes in response to changing temperatures has evolved in organisms that live where temperatures vary.
S			1.7.1.6.2.2	The two lipid layers may differ in specific lipid composition, and each protein has directional orientation in the membrane (see Figure 7.9).
S			1.7.1.4.1.2	Somewhat like a tile mosaic, a membrane is a collage of different proteins, often clustered together in groups, embedded in the fluid matrix of the lipid bilayer (see Figure 7.5).

Q	What stage of a reaction does this statment describe: "reactants are activated, and their bonds can be broken"?
A	"the transition state"
S			1.8.4.1.4.2	At the summit, when energy equivalent to EA has been absorbed, the reactants are in the transition state: They are activated, and their bonds can be broken.
S			1.8.4.1.2.1	The initial investment of energy for starting a reaction: the energy required to contort the reactant molecules so the bonds can break: is known as the free energy of activation, or activation energy, abbreviated EA in this book.
S			1.8.6.19.1	In a chemical reaction, the energy necessary to break the bonds of the reactants is the activation energy, EA.
S			1.8.4.1.2.2	We can think of activation energy as the amount of energy needed to push the reactants to the top of an energy barrier, or uphill, so that the "downhill" part of the reaction can begin.
S			1.8.4.1.1.6	To reach the contorted state where bonds can change, reactant molecules must absorb energy from their surroundings.
S			1.36.6.3.1.4	Some studies have revealed that a stimulus in one part of a plant can trigger an electrical signal in the phloem that affects another part, where it may elicit a change in gene transcription, respiration, photosynthesis, phloem unloading, or hormonal levels.
S			1.8.1.2.2.2	Moving objects can perform work by imparting motion to other matter: A pool player uses the motion of the cue stick to push the cue ball, which in turn moves the other balls; water gushing through a dam turns turbines; and the contraction of leg muscles pushes bicycle pedals.
S			1.18.2.3.2.4.3	Researchers have identified two common structural elements in a large number of activator proteins: a DNA-binding domain: a part of the protein's three-dimensional structure that binds to DNA: and one or more activation domains.
S			1.8.2.3.1.7.2	The phrase "energy stored in bonds" is shorthand for the potential energy that can be released when new bonds are formed after the original bonds break, as long as the products are of lower free energy than the reactants.
S			1.8.4.1.2.6	When the molecules have absorbed enough energy for the bonds to break, the reactants are in an unstable condition known as the transition state.

Q	Before the discovery of O2 given off by plants being derived from water, what was believed to be the main source of O2?
A	"carbon dioxide"	"CO2"
S			1.10.1.2.1.1.1	One of the first clues to the mechanism of photosynthesis came from the discovery that the O2 given off by plants is derived from H2O and not from CO2.
S			1.10.1.2.1.2	Although some of the steps are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 1800s: In the presence of light, the green parts of plants produce organic compounds and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water.
S			1.39.2.2.5.4.5	In some cases, water shortage stresses the root system before the shoot system, and ABA transported from roots to leaves may function as an "early warning system.
S			1.10.1.2.1.8.2	The experiments showed that the O2 from plants was labeled with 18O only if water was the source of the tracer (experiment 1).
S			1.36.5.3.3	The flow of water and minerals from soil to roots to leaves is largely in a direction opposite to the direction necessary for transporting sugars from mature leaves to lower parts of the plant, such as root tips that require large amounts of sugars for energy and growth.
S			1.10.1.2.1.7.1	Thus, van Niel hypothesized that plants split H2O as a source of electrons from hydrogen atoms, releasing O2 as a by-product.
S			1.35.3.2.2.4.3	This network brings xylem and phloem into close contact with the photosynthetic tissue, which obtains water and minerals from the xylem and loads its sugars and other organic products into the phloem for transport to other parts of the plant.
S			1.36.3.2.2.1	Water and minerals that pass from the soil into the root cortex cannot be transported to the rest of the plant until they enter the xylem of the vascular cylinder, or stele.
S			4.939.1.1	A chloroplast is an organelle found in plants and photosynthetic protists that absorbs sunlight and uses it to drive the synthesis of organic compounds from carbon dioxide and water.
S			1.52.4.1.1.1	One factor that contributes greatly to the global distribution of organisms is dispersal, the movement of individuals or gametes away from their area of origin or from centers of high population density.

Q	What is one example of an organism that has modified its membrane lipid composition in order to live in an extreme environment?
A	"Certain bacteria and archaea"	"fishes"
S			1.7.1.3.2.1	The ability to change the lipid composition of cell membranes in response to changing temperatures has evolved in organisms that live where temperatures vary.
S			1.1.0.0.3.1	An organism's adaptations to its environment, such as adaptations for conserving water, are the result of evolution, the process of change that has transformed life on Earth from its earliest beginnings to the diversity of organisms living today.
S			1.7.1.3.1.2	For instance, fishes that live in extreme cold have membranes with a high proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbon tails, enabling their membranes to remain fluid (see Figure 7.8a).
S			1.9.4.3.3.4	We know that 1 NADH results in 10 H+ being transported out across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but the exact number of H+ that must reenter the mitochondrial matrix via ATP synthase to generate 1 ATP has long been debated.
S			1.7.1.2.15.4	Therefore, extreme environments pose a challenge for life, resulting in evolutionary adaptations that include differences in membrane lipid composition.
S			1.40.1.2.2.2	A single-celled organism, such as the amoeba in Figure 40.3a, has a sufficient membrane surface area in contact with its environment to carry out all necessary exchange.
S			1.21.6.2.1.2	Their aim is to understand how these processes have evolved and how changes in them can modify existing organismal features or lead to new ones.
S			1.7.1.3.1.1	EVOLUTION   Variations in the cell membrane lipid compositions of many species appear to be evolutionary adaptations that maintain the appropriate membrane fluidity under specific environmental conditions.
S			1.7.6.4.5	Differences in membrane lipid composition, as well as the ability to change lipid composition, are evolutionary adaptations that ensure membrane fluidity.
S			1.23.4.5.1.23	" In addition, the environment at a particular location may change unpredictably from year to year, again limiting the extent to which adaptive evolution results in a close match between the organism and current environmental conditions.

Q	Under what environmental conditions might having a high proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the plasma membrane be advantageous?
A	"extreme cold"	"lower temperatures"
S			1.7.1.3.1.2	For instance, fishes that live in extreme cold have membranes with a high proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbon tails, enabling their membranes to remain fluid (see Figure 7.8a).
S			1.39.4.3.5.1.6	For example, membrane lipids increase in their proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, which have shapes that help keep membranes fluid at lower temperatures by impeding crystal formation (see Figure 7.8a).
S			1.7.1.3.1.1	EVOLUTION   Variations in the cell membrane lipid compositions of many species appear to be evolutionary adaptations that maintain the appropriate membrane fluidity under specific environmental conditions.
S			1.7.1.2.13.4	Because of kinks in the tails where double bonds are located, unsaturated hydrocarbon tails cannot pack together as closely as saturated hydrocarbon tails, and this makes the membrane more fluid (Figure 7.8a).
S			1.7.1.2.13.3	The membrane remains fluid to a lower temperature if it is rich in phospholipids with unsaturated hydrocarbon tails (see Figures 5.11 and 5.12).
S			1.44.5.1.10.7	To determine if the mutant aquaporin proteins made functional water channels in the plasma membrane, the investigators transferred the oocytes from a 200-mOsm to a 10-mOsm solution.
S			1.7.6.4.4	The unsaturated hydrocarbon tails of some phospholipids keep membranes fluid at lower temperatures, while cholesterol helps membranes resist changes in fluidity caused by temperature changes.
S			1.7.0.0.1.5	The ability of the cell to discriminate in its chemical exchanges with its environment is fundamental to life, and it is the plasma membrane and its component molecules that make this selectivity possible.
S			1.6.6.2.2.2.4	In animal cells specialized for transporting materials across the plasma membrane, such as intestinal cells, bundles of microfilaments make up the core of microvilli, delicate projections that increase the cell's surface area (Figure 6.26).
S			1.28.3.1.2.2	Structurally, species in this group have membrane-bounded sacs (alveoli) just under the plasma membrane (Figure 28.8).

Q	In the absence of other forces, a substance will diffuse from where it is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated, what process does this quote describe?
A	"Diffusion"	"diffusion"	"passive movement"	"passive transport"
S			1.7.3.6.1	We can now state a simple rule of diffusion: In the absence of other forces, a substance will diffuse from where it is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated.
S			1.7.3.1.1.3	Water molecules move randomly and may cross in either direction, but overall, water diffuses from the solution with less concentrated solute to that with more concentrated solute.
S			1.7.3.1.2.8	In the end, the effect is the same: Water diffuses across the membrane from the region of lower solute concentration (higher free water concentration) to that of higher solute concentration (lower free water concentration) until the solute concentrations on both sides of the membrane are equal.
S			4.1462.1.1	A diffusion is the spontaneous movement of a substance down its concentration gradient, from a region where it is more concentrated to a region where it is less concentrated.
S			1.36.3.3.2.5.2	Because water moves from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential, the more negative pressure potential at the air-water interface causes water in xylem cells to be "pulled" into mesophyll cells, which lose water to the air spaces, the water diffusing out through stomata.
S			1.16.3.15.2	This type of interphase chromatin, visible as irregular clumps with a light microscope, is called heterochromatin, to distinguish it from the less compacted, more dispersed euchromatin ("true chromatin").
S			1.50.5.2.2.7	Thus, the action potential generated by specialized cells in one part of the heart spreads to all other cardiac muscle cells, causing the whole heart to contract.
S			1.7.3.7.2	When a substance is more concentrated on one side of a membrane than on the other, there is a tendency for the substance to diffuse across the membrane down its concentration gradient (assuming that the membrane is permeable to that substance).
S			4.1470.1.1	Diffusion of CO2 across cell membrane is the passive movement of carbon dioxide from an area of high concentration on one side of the membrane to an area of lower concentration on the other side of the membrane.
S			4.1471.1.1	A diffusion of oxygen across plasma membrane is the passive movement of oxygen from an area of high concentration on one side of the membrane to an area of lower concentration on the other side of the plasma membrane.
